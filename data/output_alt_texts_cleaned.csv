Lefcourt, Epstein was ""part of the original group that conceived of the Clinton Global Initiative"".[414] In 2002, a spokesperson for Clinton praised Epstein as ""a committed philanthropist"" with ""insights and generosity"".[415] While Clinton was president, Epstein visited the White House at least 17 times between 1993 and 1995.[416][417] Years later, Epstein was convicted on sex trafficking charges. Clinton's office released a statement in 2019 saying, ""President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York. In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took four trips on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation.

History[edit]
Laurel Mountain’s distinct character is the result of a rich history. The slopes were originally designed by European skiing legend Johann ""Hannes"" Schneider, the renowned Austrian ski guide and inventor of the Arlberg Method, the basis of modern alpine ski technique. The resort opened in 1940, just before the U.S. entered World War II, and some of the original structures, including the storied Midway Cabin, still stand on the property. Once an exclusive club for the most prestigious residents of Pennsylvania, Laurel Mountain was gifted to the commonwealth in 1964 and is now a winter playground for everyone.
The resort closed for more than a decade, starting in 2005.[1][2] Laurel Mountain reopened for the 2016-2017 season after an extensive multi-year renovation project to upgrade the facility through a partnership between the Pennsylvania DCNR and Seven Springs Mountain Resort. A modern SkyTrac fixed-grip quad chairlift was installed in the summer of 2016, capable of transporting 2,400 skiers per hour. The snowmaking system was overhauled with the addition of 52 new guns and the water storage capacity nearly doubled to 26 million gallons. Several improvements were also made to the slopes including regrading and widening select areas to improve traffic flow.

Facilities[edit]
The Midway Cabin.  The original lodge at Laurel Mountain built in 1940 is located approximately halfway down the Broadway slope.  Starting in 1954 the Pittsburgh Ski Club used the cabin as their mountain headquarters.  The lodge had a dormitory that was available to members for an affordable $1.65/night.  The PSC used the lodge until approximately 1954 when the region's focus on skiing shifted towards Seven Springs and Hidden Valley.  The cabin is still standing today.
Modern Lodge.  A more modern two-story lodge of approximately 14,500 square feet was built in 1999.  The lodge offers services including retail, rental and tickets.  There is historic Pennsylvania ski memorabilia throughout.  The lodge has two restaurants, the Wildcat Lounge and the Laurel House cafe.

Lower Wildcat[edit]
Lower Wildcat is the resort's double diamond slope.  It is the steepest ski slope in Southwestern Pennsylvania reaching a 72% grade and is considered by many to be comparable to runs found at New England resorts.

He scored 10 points, shooting 1-for-11 in the second half and missing his final nine shots.[31][32] Amid the injuries, Jaquez's 3-point shooting dropped to 27.6 percent.

Early life[edit]
Russell was born at West Maitland, New South Wales, the fourth son of the Hon. Bourn Russell and his wife Jane, née Mackreth. Russell was educated at West Maitland Grammar school and the University of Sydney, (BA, 1859).[1][2]

Sydney Observatory[edit]
Russell joined the staff of the Sydney Observatory under William Scott who resigned in 1862. Russell then became acting director until 1864 until the new government astronomer, George Smalley, was appointed. On the death of Smalley on 11 July 1870[3] 
Russell became government astronomer a salary of £555[2] and held the position for 35 years. Russell immediately began reorganising and refurnishing the building, which he succeeded in getting considerably enlarged during the next seven years. With Robert L. J. Ellery, Russell organised an expedition to observe a total eclipse of the sun to Cape Sidmouth in 1871.[2]
Russell prepared for the observation of the transit of Venus in 1874 for which four observing stations were equipped. Russell arranged for a band of competent observers to staff them, and the results were generally very successful; an interesting account of them was published by Russell in 1892, Observations of the Transit of Venus.[1]

Meteorology career[edit]
Russell began to develop the meteorological side of his work, in 1877 he published a substantial volume, Climate of New South Wales: Descriptive, Historical and Tabular. In this volume some attention is given to the question of weather periodicity, on which he had written a paper in 1876. In later years he gave a great deal of attention to it. At the beginning of Russell's appointment there were only 12 observing stations in New South Wales, but before he resigned there were about 1800. There was little money for equipment, but Russell made use of available materials and designed a rain gauge which could be made at a cost of one-sixth of the imported gauges. Russell also invented various self-recording barometers, thermometers, anemometers and rain gauges. This reduced and made possible the work of his observers, almost all of whom gave their services voluntarily. In collaboration with Sir Charles Todd of South Australia, and Robert L. J. Ellery and Pietro Baracchi of Victoria, weather reporting in Australia was co-ordinated until the daily weather forecasts showed a very high percentage of accuracy. The long series of Meteorological Observations made at the Government Observatory, Sydney, published under Russell's direction contain an enormous mass of information relating to the climate of New South Wales.[1]
Russell was interested in the study of double stars and published in 1882 Results of Double Star Measures made at the Sydney Observatory 1871 to 1881. He also gave a great deal of attention to the application of photography to astronomical work. In 1887 he attended the astrographic congress at Paris and arranged for the co-operation of the Sydney observatory. This involved the taking and measurement of 1400 photographic plates. Russell supervised the preparation of the portion of the Astrographic Catalogue undertaken by the Sydney observatory until his retirement. In 1888 he was elected president of the newly formed Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science and in 1891 became vice-chancellor of the university of Sydney, but resigned within a year on account of the pressure of his other duties. By 1893 Russell had discovered 500 new double stars.[2] In 1903 Russell had a severe illness from which he never completely recovered. He had a year's leave of absence and resigned the position of government astronomer[2] in 1905. Russell died at the observatory on 22 February 1907. Russell was for some years president of the Royal Society of New South Wales, was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, London, in 1886, and was created C.M.G. in 1890. Russell contributed papers to various societies, many of which appeared in the Memoirs and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Others papers will be found in the Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales, and other journals. He also took an important part in the initiation of technical education in New South Wales.[1][2]

Family[edit]
Russell married Emily Jane, daughter of Ambrose Foss. She survived him with a son and four daughters.[1][4]

Legacy[edit]
Russell was a conscientious and enthusiastic worker; his hours of attendance at the observatory were commonly from nine in the morning until midnight. He was an excellent mechanic and was responsible for many inventions which proved to be of great value in relation with his work. His theory of a 19 years cycle in weather periodicity could not be proved on the information available, and the same may be said of the 33 years cycle of Charles Egeson, an assistant of Russell's at the observatory. Russell's paper on the Darling River read in 1879, suggesting that vast supplies of water must be flowing at a lower level was a very interesting prediction considering that artesian water was practically unknown at the time. The great value of Russell's efforts lies in the mass of tabulated work done by him or under his direction in astronomy and especially meteorology, which has been a mine of information for all workers in the subjects.[1]

Prices for the various issues can  range from inexpensive, to moderately priced to those of considerable value, depending on availability, type,[e] centering and condition.[40] The catalogue value of a Christmas seal, as with postage stamps and coins, usually increases over time. For example, in 1935 the Scott Catalogue[f] value for a Christmas seal issued in 1915 was 25-cents.[41] In 1983 its catalogue value increased to $4.  By 2014 the Scott Catalogue Value was fixed at $9.00.[42]  Used seals, and those with no gum and/or have a straight edge on one side, usually command about one-half the price of a seal in unused, (mint) fine to very fine (F-VF) condition.[43][44]

Kobakhidze criticized these actions and said that they were influenced by the ""Global War Party"".[33] He added that Georgia would not deviate from its path towards EU membership and that it would continue the process of EU integration, while calling the US and EU to ""distance themselves from calls for Georgia to engage in war"".[34] After much delay, in December 2023, Georgia was finally granted EU candidate status. Kobakhidze attributed the achievement to the Georgian Dream founder Bidzina Ivanishvili, who, in his words, “laid the foundation” to replace “Soviet-style authoritarianism” with “European-style democratic and fair governance”.[35]

While on duty he studied for the mateship examination. Because of an eye disease, however, he had to give up this naval career. In 1866 he joined the Danish postal service, and soon became a post office clerk in 1892 and was employed by Kbh., until he became postmaster in Gentofte in 1905, and in Charlottenlund in 1909.  As a member of the Danish Post Office Holbøll was able to assume a position as a board member of the Post and Telegraph Association, he conceived of the idea to use the many Christmas greetings that came through the post office for philanthropic purposes with a special Christmas label, which was to be sold as a means of raising funding to fight tuberculosis and help with other charitable efforts.  He passed this idea on to his fellow postal workers and other, most of whom though his idea had promise and subsequently the idea reached the King Christian IX of Denmark and decided to give Holbøll's idea a try.

The new bishopric was confirmed by Pope Clement III in September 1188.[2] In 1190, Clement III allowed any monk to join Meinhard's mission. New Pope Celestine III showed more enthusiastic support for the mission in his letter in April 1193, authorizing active missionary recruitment, making exceptions to rules governing monks' food and clothing, and granting indulgences to those who joined the mission.[2] Among the recruits was Theodorich from Loccum Abbey, who started a mission in Turaida (German: Treyden). Meinhard initially converted the pagans by peaceful means, but faced with resistance and apostasy, he turned to the idea of a crusade.[2]

Article 123 of the 1917 Constitution had empowered workers in an unprecedented way, guaranteeing human rights such as the minimum wage, an eight-hour workday and the right to strike and form trade unions, but in a more comprehensive fashion, Article 123 signaled that the Mexican state was firmly on the side of workers. A labor organization already existed when Cárdenas took office, the CROM union of Luis Morones. Morones was forced out of his cabinet post in Calles's government and the CROM declined in power and influence, with major defections of Mexico City unions, one of which was led by socialist Vicente Lombardo Toledano. Cárdenas promoted Toledano's ""purified"" Confederation of Mexican Workers, which evolved into the Mexican Confederation of Workers or CTM. The CTM's alliance with Cárdenas was tactical and conditional, seeing their interests being forwarded by Cárdenas, but not controlled by him.[44] As with the agrarian sector with mobilized peasants, mobilized and organized workers had long agitated and fought for their interests. Article 123 of the Constitution was a tangible result of their participation in the Mexican Revolution on the Constitutionalist side. In fact, workers organized by the Casa del Obrero Mundial, a radical labor organization, fought in the Red Battalions against the peasant revolutionaries led by Emiliano Zapata. Lombardo Toledano and the CTM supported Cárdenas's exile of Calles and in the same stroke Cárdenas also exiled CROM's discredited leader, Luis Napoleón Morones.[45]

The 6th Lord Baltimore wielded immense power in Maryland, which was then a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain, administered directly by the Calverts.[36] Frederick's inheritance coincided with a period of rising discontent in Maryland, amid growing demands by the legislative assembly for an end to his family's authoritarian rule. Frederick, however, remained aloof from the colony and never set foot in it in his lifetime. He lived a life of leisure, writing verse and regarding the Province of Maryland as little more than a source of revenue. The colony was ruled through governors appointed by the 6th Lord Baltimore. His frequent travels made him difficult to contact and meant that Maryland was largely ruled without him. His personal life was extremely scandalous by the standards of the time, and this contributed to growing unrest in his colony. In 1758, his wife ""died from a hurt she received by a fall out of a Phaeton carriage"" while accompanied by her husband. Although Frederick was suspected of foul play, no charges were ever brought.[35]","Frederick Calvert, 6th and last Baron Baltimore, ""conceited, frivolous, and dissipated""[35]","A portrait of a young man in an elaborate, richly decorated red coat with gold embroidery, standing confidently with one hand on his hip.

 Fisher was born in London and started writing poetry in 1962. In the late 1960s, he was involved with Fluxshoe, the United Kingdom offshoot of Fluxus, and performance has remained an important part of his practice.[1] He established himself as a poet through his early, decade-long, poetry project Place, which was published in a series of books and pamphlets during the 1970s. This project which drew, in part, on the Olson tradition of 'open field' projective verse poetics and, in part, on the procedural tradition of poets like Jackson Mac Low, was one of the major works of the British Poetry Revival, although it wasn't published as a single volume until 2005, when it was brought out by Ken Edwards's Reality Street.[2] After the abandonment (as planned) of Place, he worked on a project called Gravity as a consequence of shape from 1982 which he completed in 2007. As with Place, this was published in a series of books and pamphlets throughout this period. The total work amounts to some 800 pages. This project was followed by a book of emblems (poem-image-commentary) called ""Proposals"" and, in 2014, a collage book of poetry, visual images and prose quotations called ""SPUTTOR"".[3] In this work and others, the techniques of collage seen in his painting were also applied by Fisher to his poetic practice.[4] Fisher’s books are also ""deeply interested in issues involving empathy and scientific enquiry"".[5]

Edmunds also praised Newbery's design work, noting distinct accuracy in the sets.[16] Following the second episode, Bob Leeson of the Daily Worker felt that the serial had ""charm"", applauding the ""painstaking attempts for historical accuracy"" and noting a ""much tighter plot"" than previous serials.[1] The third episode was the subject of a BBC Audience Research Report in July 1964, in which a panel of 225 viewers deemed a ""falling-off of interest"" in the show; many viewers preferred the show's ""earlier space-time encounters"".[19]

New infinite series were discovered in the 1980s and 1990s that are as fast as iterative algorithms, yet are simpler and less memory intensive.[125] The fast iterative algorithms were anticipated in 1914, when Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan published dozens of innovative new formulae for π, remarkable for their elegance, mathematical depth and rapid convergence.[130] One of his formulae, based on modular equations, is

Other sculptor-architects of his time included Willem de Bruyn in Brussels, Lucas Faydherbe in Mechelen, and Jan Pieter van Baurscheit the Elder in Antwerp.[9] Cosijn was one of the sculptor-architects who contributed to the rebuilding of Brussels after its destruction in the 1695 bombardment. He designed the Maison de la Bellone/Bellonahuis on the Rue de Flandre/Vlaamsesteenweg.[10] He made the facade sculptures and was possibly the project manager for Le Roy d'Espagne/Den Coninck van Spaignien on the Grand-Place.[11] The buildings bear Baroque style decorations on an otherwise classical-looking facade. On the Grand-Place, he was in charge of the summary reconstruction and reparation of the gable top of La Brouette/Den Cruywagen (completed in 1697) and the summary reconstruction of the Bread House in 1695.[12][13]

She was Superintendent of the Literature (publications) Department of the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU).  In 1868 she presented a lecture on ""Alcohol our Enemy"" at her church and quickly became involved in anti-alcohol activities. She wrote temperance articles for the National Temperance Publishing House and the Youth's Temperance Visitor. She then became convinced that temperance should be taught in the schools, a belief shared by Mary Hunt, with whom she worked closely. In doing so she contributed significantly to Scientific Temperance Instruction and was an important part of the temperance movement.[1]

Most natural garnets are compositionally zoned and contain inclusions.[45] Its crystal lattice structure is stable at high pressures and temperatures and is thus found in green-schist facies metamorphic rocks including gneiss, hornblende schist, and mica schist.[46] The composition that is stable at the pressure and temperature conditions of Earth's mantle is pyrope, which is often found in peridotites and kimberlites, as well as the serpentines that form from them.[46] Garnets are unique in that they can record the pressures and temperatures of peak metamorphism and are used as geobarometers and geothermometers in the study of geothermobarometry which determines ""P-T Paths"", Pressure-Temperature Paths. Garnets are used as an index mineral in the delineation of isograds in metamorphic rocks.[46] Compositional zoning and inclusions can mark the change from growth of the crystals at low temperatures to higher temperatures.[47] Garnets that are not compositionally zoned more than likely experienced ultra high temperatures (above 700 °C) that led to diffusion of major elements within the crystal lattice, effectively homogenizing the crystal[47] or they were never zoned. Garnets can also form metamorphic textures that can help interpret structural histories.[47]

As she played aggressively, taking the ball early on the rise, she tended to hit large numbers of both winners and unforced errors. Bertens' greatest asset was her forehand, which was powerful and hit with heavy topspin, allowing her to hit winners from any position on the court. Her heavy topspin forehand had the added benefit of pushing her opponents behind the baseline, forcing them to play defensively from the first stroke.[47] Her two-handed backhand was also strong, and she was able to dictate play using this stroke; despite this, her backhand was less reliable than her forehand, and her backhand was responsible for the majority of the unforced errors she committed on the court. She was adept at applying slice to her backhand, which allowed her to break up the pace of baseline rallies, and draw unforced errors from more aggressive players. Her first serve was powerful, typically being delivered at 105 mph (169 km/h), and peaking at 110 mph (177 km/h), allowing her to serve aces, and dictate play from the first stroke of the rally. Bertens' second serve was less reliable, leading to a relatively high double fault count; throughout her career, however, Bertens began to develop a more effective kick serve, which minimised double faults.[48] Despite being an effective net player due to her doubles experience, Bertens rarely approached the net when playing singles, except to retrieve short balls, or to attack the net when the opportunity arose. Bertens possessed an exemplary drop shot, and was one of the strongest exponents of this shot on the WTA Tour; this shot was especially effective on clay courts, where she would deploy the shot during long baseline exchanges, to surprise opponents and move them around the court. Due to her exceptional fitness, movement, fitness, footwork, and court coverage, Bertens was an adept counterpuncher, and these skills allowed her to execute her playing style with tremendous effect. Although Bertens experienced success on all surfaces, her favourite surface was clay, where the high bounce and slow speed suited her playing style; her clay court game was aided by her ability to slide and move effectively on the surface. Despite all these strengths, Bertens' game was heavily affected by nerves throughout her career, and her lack of Grand Slam success despite being one of the most consistent players on the WTA Tour was credited to the nerves she felt when playing in front of large crowds.[49]

Khrushchev, for his part, was impressed with the president's intelligence but thought him weak. Kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to Khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them, a proposed treaty between Moscow and East Berlin. He made it clear that any treaty interfering with U.S. access rights in West Berlin would be regarded as an act of war.[186] Shortly after Kennedy returned home, the Soviet Union announced its plan to sign a treaty with East Berlin, abrogating any third-party occupation rights in either sector of the city. Kennedy assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war, which he thought had a one-in-five chance of occurring.[187]

Having achieved its design in undermining the tax, the revolt encouraged other landowners to defy Selassie.[206] In October that year, Selassie had a four-day visit to the Kingdom of Jordan hosted by King Hussein. During this trip, Selassie visited Jerusalem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.[207]

Early life and orchestral career[edit]
Dreyfus was born to a Jewish family in Elberfeld, Wuppertal, Germany. He was the younger of two sons born to Alfred Dreyfus and Hilde Ransenberg. Growing up, his family had what he described as ""pots of money, cars, Kindermädchen [nannies] and holidays in Switzerland and Czechoslovakia"". However, due to the Nazi persecution of Jews, the family was forced to move to Berlin in 1935 and then left Germany entirely. He and his brother arrived in Melbourne in July 1939 and began attending boarding school; his parents followed in December.[1]
At Melbourne High School, Dreyfus conducted the school choir and played clarinet in the school orchestra. He enrolled in the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music as a bassoonist, and then in 1948 toured for a year playing Italian opera with the J. C. Williamson touring orchestra. Dreyfus subsequently played for several years in the house orchestra of His Majesty's Theatre, Perth.[1] He joined the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra in 1953, where he played until 1964.[2] He was reputedly fired from the orchestra by Clive Douglas.[3] A grant enabled him in 1955 to continue his studies at the Imperial Academy of Music in Vienna, where he was taught by Karl Öhlberger.[1]

Composer[edit]
Dreyfus began composing in 1956 but did not concentrate on composition until the 1960s after he left the Orchestra. A UNESCO travel grant allowed him in 1966 to travel to Germany for studies with Karlheinz Stockhausen at the Rheinische Musikschule [de] in Cologne.[4] In 1972 he won the Albert H. Maggs Composition Award.
He has composed numerous film and television scores, including for The Adventures of Sebastian the Fox (1963), A Steam Train Passes (1974), Rush (1974), Dimboola (1979) and The Fringe Dwellers (1986). It was the score for Rush which brought him wider recognition and saw him immortalised in the Trivial Pursuit board game.[5]
He composed the operas Rathenau (premiered 1993 at the Staatstheater Kassel), Die Marx Sisters (premiered 1996 at the Bielefeld Opera)[6] and The Takeover (1970)[7] which had its European premiere in 1997 in Germany.[8] Other operas are Garni Sands (1966, premiered 1972)[9] and Gilt-Edged Kid (1970).
He also composed the musical The Sentimental Bloke, an adaptation of The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke with book and lyrics by Graeme Blundell. The Sentimental Bloke premiered at the Melbourne Theatre Company in December 1985.[10] He also contributed music to Manning Clark's History of Australia – The Musical which premiered in 1988.
In 1984, he published his autobiography The Last Frivolous Book, and in 1998 a book of essays. His memoir Don't Ever Let Them Get You! (Black Pepper, 2009) includes essays on his music and a complete catalogue of works. In 2011 he published Brush Off! about his struggles with Opera Australia to get his opera Gilt-Edged Kid performed. In 2019, at the age of 90, Dreyfus disrupted the opening night of Rigoletto at the State Theatre in Melbourne when he attempted to use a megaphone from the front row to protest against the company for not having performed his work.[11]
George is currently touring Melbourne with his quartet and performing his best works to the community with funding from The Pratt Foundation. He most recently performed at The Festival of Jewish Arts and Music, where at the age of 91 he is still performing the bassoon part in the arrangements he made for quartet.[12]

Massachusetts had asked for a general meeting or Continental Congress to consider joint action.  To forestall any such action, the royal governor of Maryland, Robert Eden prorogued the Assembly on April 19, 1774. [citation needed]
This was the last session of the colonial assembly ever held in Maryland. But, the assembly members agreed to meet in June at Annapolis after they went home to determine the wishes of the citizens in the counties they represented.

His first notable achievement was the Dawes Plan of 1924, which reduced Germany's overall reparations commitment, reorganized the Reichsbank and ended the occupation of the Ruhr. With President Friedrich Ebert, he secured the appointment of Hjalmar Schacht as the new president of the Reichsbank. Schacht implemented the Dawes Plan and managed the successful effort to end hyperinflation, despite his reservations about Germany's growing foreign debt under Stresemann's economic policies.[11] The successful negotiation of the Dawes Plan provided hope for Stresemann's foreign policy strategy emphasizing Germany's remaining economic soft power, since the co-author of the plan, Owen D. Young, was the chairman of General Electric and a major trading partner with the German firm AEG.[11]

Stresemann was co-winner with Aristide Briand of the 1926 Nobel Peace Prize for their work on Locarno.[34] Stresemann's success owed much to his friendly personal character and his willingness to be pragmatic. He was close personal friends with many influential foreigners, most notably Aristide Briand.[35]

Francesco_Petrarca01.jpg,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Francesco_Petrarca01.jpg/170px-Francesco_Petrarca01.jpg,Petrarch," While it is possible she was an idealized or pseudonymous character—particularly since the name ""Laura"" has a linguistic connection to the poetic ""laurels"" Petrarch coveted—Petrarch himself always denied it. His frequent use of l'aura is also remarkable: for example, the line ""Erano i capei d'oro a l'aura sparsi"" may mean both ""her hair was all over Laura's body"" and ""the wind (l'aura) blew through her hair"". There is psychological realism in the description of Laura, although Petrarch draws heavily on conventionalised descriptions of love and lovers from troubadour songs and other literature of courtly love. Her presence causes him unspeakable joy, but his unrequited love creates unendurable desires, inner conflicts between the ardent lover and the mystic Christian, making it impossible to reconcile the two. Petrarch's quest for love leads to hopelessness and irreconcilable anguish, as he expresses in the series of paradoxes in Rima 134 ""Pace non trovo, et non ò da far guerra;/e temo, et spero; et ardo, et son un ghiaccio"": ""I find no peace, and yet I make no war:/and fear, and hope: and burn, and I am ice"".[42]

Her ground strokes are very powerful.""[4] Yastremska is an aggressive baseline player, whose attacking style allows her to hit a large number of winners - she hit 33 winners in her first two finals, and 49 winners when she won her third title. Her highly aggressive playing style also lends itself to a high unforced error count, with Yastremska hitting 21, 53, and 50 unforced errors in her three final matches.[30][34][35] As of the 2019 Australian Open, Yastremska was ranked as the most aggressive player on the WTA Tour, having led the tour with 28.6 per cent of her shots ending in a winner, an unforced error, or an opponent's forced error; this statistic is known as the Aggression Score.[76][77][78] Yastremska's groundstrokes are hit with relentless power, depth, and speed, with her forehand being her best shot, due to the extreme amount of racquet head speed she creates. She is capable of winning a high percentage of points when she hits an inside-in forehand in particular, and she can hit winners from any position of the court with her forehand.[79] Despite this, Yastremska also possesses an incredibly powerful backhand, which is typically hit flat, allowing her to hit sharply angled winners. She can also strategically apply slice to her backhand, allowing her to break up the pace of rallies and construct points intelligently. Her average first serve speed is about 100 miles per hour (160 km/h), although her first serve speed can scale 116 mph (187 km/h), allowing her to serve numerous aces in any match.[80] Although she ranked in the top 20 on the WTA Tour in aces in 2019, she also ranked in the top 10 in double faults, as she tends to take risks on her second serve.[81]

Of about 4,000 artillery pieces, many were aged and horse-drawn, but about 1,700 were relatively modern, including 812 Czech 37mm and 47mm  anti-tank guns. There were also about 2,300 mortars, including 1,600 modern 81 millimetres (3.2 in) pieces, as well as twenty-four 220 millimetres (8.7 in) and 305 millimetres (12.0 in) pieces. Of 940 anti-aircraft guns, 360 were 15 millimetres (0.59 in) and 20 millimetres (0.79 in) Czech and Italian models. All of these arms were imported, from different sources, which meant that the various models often lacked proper repair and maintenance facilities.
The only mechanized units were 6 motorized infantry battalions in the three cavalry divisions, six motorized artillery regiments, two tank battalions equipped with 110 tanks, one of which had Renault FT models of World War I origin and the other 54 modern French Renault R35 tanks, plus an independent tank company with eight Czech SI-D tank destroyers. Some 1,000 trucks for military purposes had been imported from the United States in the months just preceding the invasion.[59]

The Riksdag which assembled at Stockholm in March 1655, duly considered the two great pressing national questions: war, and the restitution of the alienated crown lands. Over three days a secret committee presided over by the King decided the war question: Charles X easily persuaded the delegates that a war against Poland appeared necessary and might prove very advantageous; but the consideration of the question of the subsidies due to the crown for military purposes was postponed to the following Riksdag.[4]  In 1659 he proclaimed severe punishment for anyone hunting in the royal game reserve in Ottenby, Öland, Sweden, where he had built a long dry-stone wall separating the southern tip of the island.[citation needed]

After UW received the ball to begin the half, Penix threw a pass which was intended for Tybo Rogers but was intercepted by cornerback Will Johnson at the Washington 32-yard line. Michigan extended their lead to ten points after a three-minute drive that resulted in a 38-yard Turner field goal. Washington scored a field goal on their following drive, which was advanced down the field in part because of an unnecessary roughness penalty called on defensive back Makari Paige. The kick was from a distance of 45 yards and made by Gross, narrowing the Michigan advantage back down to seven points. The remainder of the third quarter consisted of the teams trading punts; only four first downs were recorded by both teams combined in the remaining 8:58 of the quarter and neither team crossed midfield. The quarter ended after a completed 12-yard pass from Penix to tight end Jack Westover which moved the ball to the Washington 23-yard line, with Michigan leading 20–13.[54]

Carlo_Ferrario.jpg,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Carlo_Ferrario.jpg/200px-Carlo_Ferrario.jpg,Carlo_Ferrario_(painter)," Carlo Ferrario (7 September 1833, Milan - 11 May 1907, Milan) was an Italian scenic designer, painter, and architect.
 
Biography[edit]
He was born to Giuseppe Ferrario, a blacksmith, and his wife Francesca née Basulli. While still a boy, he was forced to quit school and find work. One of his jobs was tending the shop for a local decorator. Already interested in the theater, this inspired him to copy the curtains and draperies he saw there. In 1852, he enrolled in the night courses at the Brera Academy, where he studied under the guidance of  Enrico Robecchi (1827-1889). The following year, he was hired at La Scala, as an assistant to the stage manager.[1]
In 1859 Luigi Bisi, professor of perspective at the academy, called him to serve as an adjunct there.[2] He was named co-director at La Scala in 1867 and, the following year, became the Director of scenography. During this period he created curtains for several theaters in Milan. In 1878, he also provided stage settings for the opera Salvator Rosa, at the Teatro Argentina in Rome.[1]
Due to disagreements with the theater's management company, over the necessity of a technical laboratory for designers, he left La Scala in 1881 and went to the Teatro Carcano. There, he worked without an assistant and often collaborated at other theaters, including the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples. He returned to La Scala in 1887, at the request of Giuseppe Verdi, who wanted him to produce the settings for Otello.[1] This led to his reinstatement and a new laboratory. During the 1890s, he worked with Verdi on two more premieres, Falstaff and Rigoletto, as well as the Italian premieres of works by Wagner.
Approximately 600 drawings and sketches of his designs are preserved at the La Scala Museum. Many others may be found at the Casa Ricordi publishing house and in private collections, including the Donald Oenslager collection in New York.
In addition to his theater work, he painted landscapes and architectural interior scenes, in oil and watercolors. These included six panels for the new façade at Milan Cathedral. They were awarded the Canonica Prize in 1883.[1] Together with Giuseppe Bertini, he decorated some rooms at the Turati Palace [it]. In 1882, he participated in the competition for a monument to Victor Emmanuel II,[2] for which he was awarded a gold medal.

In July 1915, she was transferred to Mudros to attempt to penetrate the Dardanelles. After making a reconnaissance flight over the straits and having studied the reports of the British submarines that had successfully entered the Dardanelles, Lieutenant de vaisseau Auguste Farbre ordered his crew to cast off on the evening of 25 July. Escorted by the French destroyer Poignard to the mouth of the Dardanelles, she rounded Cape Helles on the surface, but dived to avoid being spotted by a searchlight about an hour later and attempted to pass underneath a minefield near Çanakkale. The boat became entangled in the cables and when she surfaced in an unsuccessful attempt to free herself, she was immediately engaged by a Turkish gun battery at close range. Mariotte could not submerge because her conning tower had been penetrated by shells so Farbre decided to scuttle the boat and surrender. The Turks ceased fire when he signaled his surrender and so his crew was able to destroy documents and equipment before opening the seacocks to sink the submarine. The wreck lies off Cape Nara near a Turkish naval base at a depth of 5 meters (16 ft).[9]

The other eight all orbit beyond Neptune. Orcus, Pluto, Haumea, Quaoar, and Makemake orbit in the Kuiper belt, which is a second belt of small Solar System bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. Gonggong and Eris orbit in the scattered disc, which is somewhat further out and, unlike the Kuiper belt, is unstable towards interactions with Neptune. Sedna is the largest known detached object, a population that never comes close enough to the Sun to interact with any of the classical planets; the origins of their orbits are still being debated. All nine are similar to terrestrial planets in having a solid surface, but they are made of ice and rock rather than rock and metal. Moreover, all of them are smaller than Mercury, with Pluto being the largest known dwarf planet and Eris being the most massive.[34][35]

He wrote and directed twenty feature films, including the two-part Joan the Maiden, eight short films and a three-part television documentary. He also acted in small roles and participated in documentaries.[1] After making his first short film, Aux quatre coins, in his hometown of Rouen,[2] Rivette moved to Paris in 1949 to pursue a career in filmmaking.[3] While attending film screenings at Henri Langlois' Cinémathèque Française and other ciné-clubs he gradually befriended many future members of the French New Wave, including François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Éric Rohmer and Claude Chabrol.[4] Rivette's association with this group of young cinephiles led to the start of both his filmmaking career and his work in film criticism. In collaboration with his new friends, Rivette made two more short films and worked as a cinematographer and editor on films by Rohmer and Truffaut.[5][6][7] He also worked in small roles and as an assistant director to Jean Renoir on French Cancan and Jacques Becker on Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves.[8][9][10] During this period he began writing film criticism for the magazine Gazette du Cinéma and later Cahiers du Cinéma,[3][11] and was one of the most respected writers by his peers.[12]

Maximilian_1470.png,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Maximilian_1470.png/170px-Maximilian_1470.png,Archery," Tribesmen of Central Asia (after the domestication of the horse) and American Plains Indians (after gaining access to horses by Europeans)[22] became extremely adept at archery on horseback. Lightly armoured, but highly mobile archers were excellently suited to warfare in the Central Asian steppes, and they formed a large part of armies that repeatedly conquered large areas of Eurasia. Shorter bows are more suited to use on horseback, and the composite bow enabled mounted archers to use powerful weapons.[23] Seljuk Turks used mounted archers against the European First Crusade, especially at the Battle of Dorylaeum (1097). Their tactic was to shoot at the enemy infantry, and use their superior mobility to prevent the enemy from closing with them. Empires throughout the Eurasian landmass often strongly associated their respective ""barbarian"" counterparts with the usage of the bow and arrow, to the point where powerful states like the Han dynasty referred to their neighbours, the Xiong-nu, as ""Those Who Draw the Bow"".[24] For example, Xiong-nu mounted bowmen made them more than a match for the Han military, and their threat was at least partially responsible for Chinese expansion into the Ordos region, to create a stronger, more powerful buffer zone against them.[24] It is possible that ""barbarian"" peoples were responsible for introducing archery or certain types of bows to their ""civilized"" counterparts – the Xiong-nu and the Han being one example. Similarly, short bows seem to have been introduced to Japan by northeast Asian groups.[25]

Armenian Hayk and Babylonian Marduk, Indian Karna (also known as Radheya/son of Radha), Abhimanyu, Eklavya, Arjuna, Bhishma, Drona, Rama, and Shiva were known for their shooting skills. The famous archery competition of hitting the eye of a rotating fish while watching its reflection in the water bowl was one of the many archery skills depicted in the Mahabharata.[48]
Persian Arash was a famous archer. Earlier Greek representations of Heracles normally depict him as an archer. Archery, and the bow, play an important part in the epic poem the Odyssey, when Odysseus returns home in disguise and then bests the suitors in an archery competition after hinting at his identity by stringing and drawing his great bow that only he can draw, a similar motif is present in the Turkic Iranian heroic archeheroic poem Alpamysh.[49]

 Warm-water port[edit] A warm-water port (also known as an ice-free port) is one where the water does not freeze in winter. This is mainly used in the context of countries with mostly cold winters where parts of the coastline freezes over every winter. Because they are available year-round, warm-water ports can be of great geopolitical or economic interest. Such settlements as Narvik in Norway, Dalian in China, Murmansk, Novorossiysk, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and Vostochny Port[16] in Russia, Odesa in Ukraine, Kushiro in Japan and Valdez at the terminus of the Alaska Pipeline owe their very existence to being ice-free ports. The Baltic Sea and similar areas have ports available year-round beginning in the 20th century thanks to icebreakers, but earlier access problems prompted Russia to expand its territory to the Black Sea.[citation needed]

Following his studies with Joseph Halévy in Paris, he dedicated himself to supporting the Beta Israel. Between 1904 and 1946, Faitlovitch embarked on eleven journeys to Ethiopia, founding schools and raising funds to foster Jewish identity among them. His efforts significantly contributed to the Beta Israel’s shift from their indigenous religious practices and their integration into the global Jewish community, paving the way for their eventual migration to Israel.

Lakhnauti was the capital of the Sena dynasty. According to historical accounts, Ghurid cavalry swept across the Gangetic plains towards Bengal. They entered the Bengali capital disguised as horse traders. Once inside the royal compound, Bakhtiyar and his horsemen swiftly overpowered the guards of the Sena king who had just sat down to eat a meal. The king then hastily fled to the forest with his followers.[41] The overthrow of the Sena king has been described as a coup d'état, which ""inaugurated an era, lasting over five centuries, during which most of Bengal was dominated by rulers professing the Islamic faith. In itself this was not exceptional, since from about this time until the eighteenth century, Muslim sovereigns ruled over most of the Indian subcontinent. What was exceptional, however, was that among India's interior provinces only in Bengal—a region approximately the size of England and Scotland combined—did a majority of the indigenous population adopt the religion of the ruling class, Islam"".[41] Bengal became a province of the Delhi Sultanate. A coin featuring a horseman was issued to celebrate the Muslim conquest of Lakhnauti with inscriptions in Sanskrit and Arabic. An abortive Islamic invasion of Tibet was also mounted by Bakhtiyar. Bengal was under the formal rule of the Delhi Sultanate for approximately 150 years. Delhi struggled to consolidate control over Bengal. Rebel governors often sought to assert autonomy or independence. Sultan Iltutmish re-established control over Bengal in 1225 after suppressing the rebels. Due to the considerable overland distance, Delhi's authority in Bengal was relatively weak. It was left to local governors to expand territory and bring new areas under Muslim rule, such as through the Conquest of Sylhet in 1303.

There, he was swept 3-0 by hypertapper Joseph ""JdMfX_"" Saelee despite setting competition personal bests. During his post-match interview, when asked if he was again contemplating retirement, Neubauer reaffirmed that he plans to keep competing indefinitely regardless of whether he was the favorite to win or not.[18] In 2019, Neubauer returned to the competition, looking to reclaim his title, but he lost the first round 2–1 to veteran competitor Paul ""MegaRetroMan"" Tesi, marking the first time Neubauer didn't reach the finals in a competition.[22]

This memorandum, when it came to light after the war, played a key role in refuting Frank's claims that he had no knowledge that Jews were being murdered en masse in the extermination camps of Operation Reinhard.

A trapiche emerald exhibits a ""star"" pattern; it has raylike spokes of dark carbon impurities that give the emerald a six-pointed radial pattern. It is named for the trapiche, a grinding wheel used to process sugarcane in the region. Colombian emeralds are generally the most prized due to their transparency and fire. Some of the rarest emeralds come from the two main emerald belts in the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes: Muzo and Coscuez west of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, and Chivor and Somondoco to the east. Fine emeralds are also found in other countries, such as Zambia, Brazil, Zimbabwe, Madagascar, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan and Russia. In the US, emeralds can be found in Hiddenite, North Carolina. In 1998, emeralds were discovered in Yukon.

It was much planted to form avenues in 17th and early 18th century landscape planning. A famous example is Unter den Linden in Berlin. It is also widely cultivated in North America as a substitute for the native Tilia americana (American linden or basswood) which has a larger leaf, coarser in texture; there it has been renamed ""Little-leaf Linden"". It is popular as a shade tree with its dense canopy, as an ornamental tree with its architectural shape, and as a street tree. In the US, Tilia cordata has been planted in Wellesley, MA; Modesto, CA; Chicago, IL; Indianapolis, IN; and Atlanta, GA as street trees.[17] In Europe, there are espaliered trees owing to the ability to survive heavy pruning. Tilia cordata is an easy tree to train for bonsai when the training is not done all at once. Letting the tree recoup in between sessions over a period of several months creates a healthy, good-looking miniature tree.[18]  Prior to the advent of firearms, it was also commonly used for making shields (as referenced in Beowulf).

Here, truck inner tubes are completely deflated so that a diver can slip them over the logs. After this occurs and once the tubes are securely in place, a hookah compressor and a low-pressure hose re-inflates them so that they form a tight grip around the floating logs. This process gives the logs more buoyancy and gives loggers easier access points to harvest them. As many tubes that are needed are used to float the logs.[4]

 The history of mythical or folkloric gift-bringing figures who appear in winter, often at or around the Christmas period, is complex, and in many countries the gift-bringer – and the gift-bringer's date of arrival – has changed over time as native customs have been influenced by those in other countries.  While many though not all gift-bringers originated as religious figures, gift-bringing is often now a non-religious custom and secular figures exist in many countries that have little or no tradition of celebrating Christmas as a religious festival. Some figures are entirely local, and some have been deliberately and more recently invented.

He took over the role from Valtteri Filppula, who joined the New York Islanders during the off-season.[60] Couturier had a slow start to the season, putting up only three goals in his first nine games.[61] By late October, Couturier had found his stride, and returned to a line with Giroux and Konecny. After Hakstol was abruptly fired, however, interim coach Scott Gordon pushed Giroux back to centre, pairing Couturier with Voráček and rotating the third member of their line.[62] On January 16, 2019, in a 4–3 victory over the Bruins, Couturier scored his first regular season hat trick. Coming the game after a similar effort from James van Riemsdyk, it was the first time that the Flyers had posted hat tricks in consecutive games since 2003.[63] Couturier's steady production carried through the remainder of the season; by late March, he had passed 30 goals and 40 assists for the second season in a row.[64] He finished the season with 33 goals and 43 assists in 80 games,[62] and, at the end of the season, he took home the Bobby Clarke Trophy for the Flyers' most valuable player, as voted by sportswriters and sportscasters. He also won the Gene Hart Memorial Award for the second consecutive year.[65]

During the series, he played on a line with Kevin Hayes and Travis Konecny.[40] Laughton recorded a two-goal and one assist game on August 6, to send the Canadiens on the brink of elimination.[41] They pushed past the Canadiens the following game to qualify for the second round of the playoffs against the New York Islanders.[42] As they faced elimination against the Islanders by game five, Laughton helped the team recover from a lost lead and recorded the overtime game-winning goal off an assist from Konecny. It was his second point of the night and first overtime goal (playoff or regular season) in his career.[43] As a result, Laughton became the sixth player in franchise history to score an overtime goal to keep the team in the series.[44] During the next game, he recorded the game-tying shorthanded goal in the third period in an eventual 5–4 overtime win to send the series to the seventh game.[45] In game seven Laughton recorded a fight and six hits in a 4–0 shutout loss to the Islanders.[46]

After folk singer Pete Seeger witnessed the power of their congregational-style of singing, which fused black Baptist a cappella church singing with popular music at the time, as well as protest songs and chants. Churches were considered to be safe spaces, acting as a shelter from the racism of the outside world. As a result, churches paved the way for the creation of the freedom song.[1] After witnessing the influence of freedom songs, Seeger suggested The Freedom Singers as a touring group to the SNCC executive secretary James Forman as a way to fuel future campaigns. Intrinsically connected, their performances drew aid and support to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) during the emerging civil rights movement. As a result, communal song became essential to empowering and educating audiences about civil rights issues and a powerful social weapon of influence in the fight against Jim Crow segregation.[2][3][4] Their most notable song “We Shall Not Be Moved” translated from the original Freedom Singers to the second generation of Freedom Singers, and finally to the Freedom Voices, made up of field secretaries from SNCC.[1] ""We Shall Not Be Moved"" is considered by many to be the ""face"" of the Civil Rights movement. Rutha Mae Harris, a former freedom singer, speculated that without the music force of broad communal singing, the civil rights movement may not have resonated beyond the struggles of the Jim Crow South. Since the Freedom Singers were so successful, a second group was created called the Freedom Voices.[1]

During the 1650s, the colony experienced dramatic growth and became a major port for trade in the Atlantic World, tolerating a highly diverse ethnic mix. The surrender of Fort Amsterdam to the British control in 1664 was formalized in 1667, contributing to the Second Anglo–Dutch War. In 1673 the Dutch re-took the area, but later relinquished it under the 5 April 1674 Treaty of Westminster ending the Third Anglo-Dutch War.[72]

At the top of each pier, facing the nave, is a carved human face. The roofs are divided into panels and contain much carving, including bosses (protrusions), shields, inscriptions and three pendants.[4] The chapel at the west end of the south aisle is known as the Lady Chapel, and that on the north side is dedicated to Saint Mary.[1][4] The church contains more medieval fittings and furniture than any other Cheshire church.[2] Between the nave and the chancel is a screen, and there are parclose screens between the aisles and the chapels.[2] The chancel screen, dated 1500, is elaborately carved with representations of birds, roses, vines and foliage. It has ten bays with lierne vaulting. The chancel stalls and the carved wooden eagle lectern date from around the same period.[2] The lectern is one of the oldest eagle lecterns in the United Kingdom.[7] The stalls have hinged seats, and formerly had misericords (shelves to support a standing person).[4] Much of the furniture dates from the 17th century and is in Jacobean style. This includes the altar rails, the octagonal pulpit, the box pews, the reredos (screen behind the altar) in the Lady Chapel, and the font cover.[1][2] The font itself is Perpendicular.[4] The reredos in the chancel of 1866 was designed by the Manchester architect J.

Ku further argued that Furina deserved a happier ending and expressed hope that miHoYo would provide her character with a more fulfilling conclusion in the future.[5] Ku later wrote that she ""wholeheartedly"" believed Furina to be the best Archon in the game.[23] GamesRadar+'s Austin Wood echoed these thoughts, directly comparing Furina's character arc to the story of ""The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas"", in which a great city prospers at the cost of one child being sentenced to misery. If said child is saved, then the city would crumble. Wood wrote that Furina was Fontaine's equivalent to the nameless child ""almost shockingly one-to-one.""

The idea was given more support by Colonel Henry Marshall Tory with collaboration from Canadian Universities to start ""Khaki colleges"" in England. Oliver also worked with Colonel G.W. Birks who headed the YMCA. On December 16, 1917 Oliver met Lt.General Sir Arthur Currie who assigned Oliver as Officer in Charge of Technical and Vocational Education. Initially the scheme in France under Oliver and the scheme in England under Tory had considerable differences. Colonel Tory's plan for a more formal ""Khaki University"" was approved on November 8, 1918 and provided for the establishment of a Department of Educational Services in the Overseas Forces of Canada, the Khaki University of Canada.  The Khaki colleges initially included a range of subjects from secondary, high school and matriculation to provide prerequisites for entry into Canadian and British universities. The scheme was backed by the Canadian general including Sir Robert Borden. The YMCA raised $500,000 and by armistice day about 14 colleges across England were in operation. Nearly 650000 soldiers attended the lectures with an enrolment of 50000 and nearly 2000 registered at the Khaki University at Ripon.[1][2]

Two of the warships, Mersey and Severn, armed with a pair of 6 in (152 mm) guns each, were brought from Britain.[31] Königsberg had in the meantime been moved a third time, even further upriver.[19] On 6 July 1915, the two monitors crossed the outer sandbar and steamed up the river, despite heavy fire from German positions on the river banks. They stopped at a point they thought to be 10,000 yd (9,100 m) from Königsberg, which would be in range of their own guns but farther than the smaller German guns could reply. Aircraft were used to spot the fall of shot. The monitors' navigation was faulty, however, and after opening fire, they found themselves to be within range of Königsberg's guns.[31] She hit Mersey twice in the engagement; one shell disabled the forward 6-inch gun, and another holed the ship below the waterline. Königsberg was hit four times in return, one shell striking beneath the waterline and causing some flooding.[32] In the span of three hours, Königsberg forced both British ships to withdraw.[31]

The portions closest to each shore landing had additional protective armour wires. Gutta-percha, a natural polymer similar to rubber, had nearly ideal properties for insulating submarine cables, with the exception of a rather high dielectric constant which made cable capacitance high. William Thomas Henley had developed a machine in 1837 for covering wires with silk or cotton thread that he developed into a wire wrapping capability for submarine cable with a factory in 1857 that became W.T. Henley's Telegraph Works Co., Ltd.[24][25] The India Rubber, Gutta Percha and Telegraph Works Company, established by the Silver family and giving that name to a section of London, furnished cores to Henley's as well as eventually making and laying finished cable.[25] In 1870 William Hooper established Hooper's Telegraph Works to manufacture his patented vulcanized rubber core, at first to furnish other makers of finished cable, that began to compete with the gutta-percha cores. The company later expanded into complete cable manufacture and cable laying, including the building of the first cable ship specifically designed to lay transatlantic cables.[25][26][27]

Its solid red brick outline is visible for miles around. Whilst in 1932 this was far outside the town of Guildford, the growth since then has already begun to wrap around the cathedral to the west and south.

Unusually, Maufe's contract included complete control over the internal fittings and colour scheme of the cathedral. This colour scheme references Guildford's wool trade past, notably the blue colour for which Guildford wool was famous. The 1,447 kneelers, using a combination of standard and individual designs, were each reviewed and approved by Lady Maufe and her committee. They were made by over 400 individuals, mainly from the British Isles, but including people from other countries, such as Australia and New Zealand. Whilst most were made during the late 1950s and early 1960s, there are examples dating back to the late 1930s, and they collectively form a fascinating record of society and life at that time.

Admiral Cunningham took the fleet to sea on 7 July to meet two convoys travelling from Malta to Alexandria, knowing that part of the Italian fleet was escorting its own convoy to Tripoli. Cunningham hoped to draw the Regia Marina into battle by sailing towards the ""toe"" of Italy to cut them off from their base at Taranto.[56] The two fleets eventually met 30 miles from Punta Stilo at the Battle of Calabria on 9 July 1940. Initially, the Allied cruisers, armed with 6-inch guns, were outranged by the 8-inch guns of their heavier Italian counterparts and disengaged. Seeing that they were under pressure, Cunningham took Warspite ahead to assist his cruisers. The Italian cruisers turned away under a smoke screen while the battleships Giulio Cesare and Conte di Cavour closed on Warspite before Malaya and Royal Sovereign could catch up.[57]

Third series coupés can be distinguished by the rear tail lights, grouped in a single unit making up the edge of the rear—more vertical—tail fins.
In the spring of 1960 the updated 60 HP engine was adopted.[16] Later in the production run production was moved to Carrozzeria Viotti. Viotti-built cars were identical to Pinin Farina's, although late ones were based on a reinforced 812.04 chassis and had fibreglass instead of aluminium dashboards, and steel instead of fibreglass boot lids.
Production amounted to 302 second series cars all built by Pinin Farina, and some 785 third series cars made by Pinin Farina and Viotti. 1,087 cars were built overall, from 1957 to 1963.

In the Spring 1959 chassis upgraded to third series specifications were phased in.[22] From the autumn newly enacted Italian traffic laws prohibited headlights cover. GTEs for Italy and some export countries had open headlights, and modified bodywork setting them further forward.[22] During 1960 the improved 60 PS engine was adopted. When the Appia Sport was introduced it did not supersede the GTE, but rather some of its features were carried over, such as new headlights and protruding in place of flush pushbutton door handles.[22] The last GTEs were built on a specific 812.03 chassis; the very last example was completed in April 1962.[22]
It is estimated that total GTE production amounts to 167 with the earlier 53 PS engine, and 134 with the later 60 PS one.[22]

Ford halted development of the saloon, termed XJ90, and proposed to install its new engine and front and rear ends onto the centre section of the XJ40 model; however, the V8 was not ready until after the X308 model, and the X300 went on to become one of Jaguar's most successful models.[27] With the introduction of the X308 generation in 1997 came a switch from the XJ6 and XJ12 nomenclature to XJ8, reflecting the fact that the X308 cars were powered by a new V8 engine. The exterior styling of the X308 is similar to the X300 with minor refinements. The biggest change in the appearance was the switch to a stylistically rounded design for all of the exterior lights, indicators and interior trim and fittings, including information displays and switches.[28]

The archducal regime had plans to bypass the blockade with a system of canals linking Ostend via Bruges to the Scheldt in Ghent and joining the Meuse to the Rhine between Venlo and Rheinberg. In order to combat urban poverty, the government supported the creation of a network of Monti di Pietà based on the Italian model.

Painted in the Baroque tradition of depicting women as soft-bodied, passive, and to the modern eye highly sexualised beings, his nudes emphasise the concepts of fertility, desire, physical beauty, temptation, and virtue. Skilfully rendered, these paintings of nude women are thought by feminists to have been created to sexually appeal to his largely male audience of patrons,[45] although the female nude as an example of beauty has been a traditional motif in European art for centuries. Rubens was quite fond of painting full-figured women, giving rise to terms like 'Rubensian' or 'Rubenesque' (sometimes 'Rubensesque'). His large-scale cycle representing Marie de' Medici focuses on several classic female archetypes like the virgin, consort, wife, widow, and diplomatic regent.[46] The inclusion of this iconography in his female portraits, along with his art depicting noblewomen of the day, serve to elevate his female portrait sitters to the status and importance of his male portrait sitters.[46]

As bishop he had access to the Chalcedonian Merovingian princess Ingunthis, who had come as a bride for the kingdom's heir, and he assisted her to convert her husband Hermenegild, the eldest son of Liuvigild, an act that cannot honestly be divorced from a political context. Leander defended the new convert even when he went to war with his father ""against his father's cruel reprisals"". Pierre Suau puts it, ""In endeavoring to save his country from Arianism, Leander showed himself an orthodox Christian and a far-sighted patriot.""[2]

GoliaPavel-foto_Berthold.jpg,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/GoliaPavel-foto_Berthold.jpg/220px-GoliaPavel-foto_Berthold.jpg,Pavel_Golia," Pavel Golia (10 April 1887 – 15 August 1959) was a Slovenian poet and playwright.
 
Life[edit]
Pavel Golia was born in a relatively wealthy family in Trebnje. Between 1907 and 1915, he served as an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army. In 1918, he was a journalist in Moscow. Later, he worked as a dramaturge or manager of the national theaters in Ljubljana (1920–46, with a two-year break), Osijek, and Belgrade. He died in Ljubljana.

Work[edit]
Golia wrote his first collection of poems, titled Alkohol (""Alcohol""), in 1908. It was published only in 1914. He wrote poems for about 40 years. According to the literary historian Igor Grdina, Golia was an intimate poet who wrote about alcoholism, prostitution, and deviant people. Emotions in his poetry are not serious. He was influenced by Oton Župančič, but developed his own form, sometimes closer to artistry.
Golia has been praised for his plays, particularly the ones written for children. He published his first play Peterčkove poslednje sanje: božična povest v štirih slikah s prologom (""Peter's Final Dreams: A Christmas Play in Four Images with a Prologue"") in 1923. His most known children plays are Princeska in pastirček (""A Princess and a Shepherd Boy""), Jurček (""Little George""), Srce igrač (""The Heart of Toys""), Uboga Ančka (""Poor Little Annie""), and Sneguljčica (""Snow White""). The expert in Slovenian youth literature Igor Saksida placed him among the best Slovenian children's playwrights.

Commemoration[edit]
Pavel Golia's birth house in Trebnje
The Municipality of Trebnje celebrates 10 April as Pavel Golia Memorial Day. The library in Trebnje is named after him.

The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden, depicts a distressed Adam and Eve, chased from the garden by a threatening angel.  Adam covers his entire face to express his shame, while Eve covers her breasts and groin. The fresco had a huge influence on Michelangelo and his work. Another major work is The Tribute Money in which Jesus and the Apostles are depicted as neo-classical archetypes. Scholars have often noted that the shadows of the figures all fall away from the chapel window, as if the figures are lit by it; this is an added stroke of verisimilitude and further tribute to Masaccio's innovative genius. In the Resurrection of the Son of Theophilus, he painted a pavement in perspective, framed by large buildings to obtain a three-dimensional space in which the figures are placed proportionate to their surroundings. In this he was a pioneer in applying the newly discovered rules of perspective.

Kirk Alyn became the first actor to portray the hero onscreen. The production cost up to $325,000[112] (equivalent to $4,121,000 in 2023). It was the most profitable movie serial in movie history.[113] A sequel serial, Atom Man vs. Superman, was released in 1950. For flying scenes, Superman was hand-drawn in animated form, composited onto live-action footage.
The first feature film was Superman and the Mole Men, a 58-minute B-movie released in 1951, produced on an estimated budget of $30,000 (equivalent to $352,000 in 2023).[114] It starred George Reeves as Superman, and was intended to promote the subsequent television series.[115]
The first big-budget movie was Superman in 1978, starring Christopher Reeve and produced by Alexander and Ilya Salkind. It was 143 minutes long and was made on a budget of $55 million (equivalent to $257,000,000 in 2023). It is the most successful Superman feature film to date in terms of box office revenue adjusted for inflation.[116] The soundtrack was composed by John Williams and was nominated for an Academy Award. Superman (1978) was the first big-budget superhero movie, and its success arguably paved the way for later superhero movies like Batman (1989) and Spider-Man (2002).[117][118][119]
The 1978 film spawned three sequels: Superman II (1980), Superman III (1983), Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987).
In 2006, Superman Returns was released, designed after the 1978–1987 film series. Superman was portrayed by Brandon Routh, who later reprised his role in the Arrowverse crossover Crisis on Infinite Earths (2019–2020).
Superman has appeared in a series of direct-to-video animated films produced by Warner Bros. Animation called DC Universe Animated Original Movies, beginning with Superman: Doomsday in 2007. Many of these movies are adaptations of popular comic book stories.
Superman appeared in the theatrical animated feature film Teen Titans Go! To the Movies (2018), voiced by Nicolas Cage.
Superman appeared in the theatrical animated feature film DC League of Super-Pets (2022), voiced by John Krasinski.","Kirk Alyn as Superman, 1948","Black and white photograph of a man in a superhero costume featuring a prominent ""S"" emblem on his chest.

Schuele, ""A consensus emerged whereby the constitutional guarantee of married women's property rights was viewed as a progressive enactment boldly distinguishing the Golden State from eastern jurisdictions struggling to emerge from the grips of antiquated notions of law and patriarchy.""[43] In 1850, however, the California State Legislature enacted property laws that expressly undermined certain aspects of the constitutional guarantee.[44] In particular, one statute provided that the husband had management and control even of the wife's separate property, although he could not sell or encumber the property without the wife's consent made in writing and confirmed outside the presence of the husband.[45] California also adopted community property laws when it became a state, giving each spouse a right to half of whatever was acquired during the marriage.[46]

Along with advice on the practices of the besieged, this alliance represented powerful help to the Christians. As a first test of submission, Abed gave James I twenty horses laden with oats, and goats and chickens, while the king gave him one of his banners, so that his messengers could appear before the Christian hosts without being attacked.[76]

Notably, he was promoted to Major General in August 2010 and later to Lieutenant General in September 2013. Giang's leadership was further recognized when he was elected to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam in January 2016. Subsequently, he assumed roles such as Deputy Minister of National Defense and Chief of General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army. In April 2021, he was appointed Minister of National Defense.

By the end of 2002, 1,544 people had settled there and in other locations, while another 14,122 had travelled to South Korea on short-term visits at the expense of the Japanese government.[41] South Korean investors also began to participate in the international tenders for works contracts to develop the Sakhalin Shelf, as they are interested in the potential supply of liquefied natural gas. By the year 2000, South Korean missionaries had opened several churches, and South Koreans comprised the majority of international students at the Sakhalin State University.[4] The Korean Association of Sakhalin, an ethnic representative body, is generally described as being pro-South Korean, analogous to Japan's Mindan.[31] In addition to the elderly, a few younger Koreans have also chosen to move to South Korea, either to find their roots, or for economic reasons, as wages in South Korea are as much as three times those in Sakhalin. However, upon arrival, they often find that they are viewed as foreigners by the South Korean locals, despite their previous exposure to Korean culture in Sakhalin. As one returnee put it, ""Sakhalin Koreans live in a different world than Sakhalin Russians but that world isn’t Korea"".[42] In general, younger Sakhalin Koreans, especially those lacking fluency in the Korean language, prefer to stay on Sakhalin.[43] Of the 1,544 Koreans who repatriated to South Korea as of 2005[update], nearly 10% eventually returned to Sakhalin.[1] Conversely, some foreign students from Korea studying in Sakhalin also reported difficulties in befriending local Koreans, claiming that the latter looked down on them for being foreigners.[44]

He proved to be a brilliant, strategic planner and combat leader, as he selected the targets, planned, and directed the missions for Operation Big Week of February of 1944. These concentrated bombing strikes were the beginning of the 1,000-plane raids over Germany, which marked the turning point of the air war over Europe. He was promoted to brigadier general on September 18, 1942 and promoted to major general on February 28, 1944.

Later, his reactions to Middle East politics resulted in works such as Jerusalem, Jerusalem and This might be a double cross jack.[citation needed]

Career[edit]
Fromholtz began playing tennis at the age of seven. She left school at the age of 16 to play in international tournaments. She turned pro in 1973 and joined the WTA Tour.[citation needed]
At the age of 17, she participated in the professional tennis circuit, winning the singles title at a dozen tournaments in 1973, but the rules at the time did not permit prize money to be paid to participants under 18 years of age.[1]
She reached the finals of the Australian Open in January 1977, losing to fellow Australian Kerry Melville Reid in two sets. She was a semifinalist at the French Open in 1979 and 1980. She also reached the semifinals of the US Open in 1976.

Dianne Fromholtz Balestrat in Wimbledon Mixed Doubles with Tom Okker in the background, 1985
Fromholtz won eight WTA Tour singles titles and reached a career-high ranking of world No. 4 in 1979. Partnering with Helen Gourlay Cawley, she won the Australian Open women's doubles in January 1977. She had career wins over Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, Billie Jean King, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, Margaret Court, Virginia Wade, Pam Shriver, and Gabriela Sabatini. She holds an 8–7 career record over King.
Fromholtz met French businessman Claude Balestrat at a New Year's Eve party in 1981, and the couple wed in Dural on 26 December 1982.[2]
On 30 August 2000, Fromholtz was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for her commitment to tennis.[3]
In 2019, Fromholtz was inducted into the Australian Tennis Hall of Fame, commemorated by a bronze bust located in Garden Square, within Melbourne Park.[4]

It is centred on the Crown Street Mall and Wollongong Central, and approximates the area bounded by Market, Corrimal, and Burelli streets and the railway line. Surrounding the CBD lies a mixture of parks, reserves, light commercial property, houses and multi-story residential units. Multi-story housing is evident particularly on Smith's Hill, north-east of the CBD, reflecting the popularity of combining inner-city living, coastal views and a beachside lifestyle.
To the east of the city lies Flagstaff Point, a rocky headland with eroded low cliffs topped by a grassy hill. The northern side of the point was excavated by convict labour to form Belmore Basin. This was later extended with the northern breakwater to create Wollongong Harbour. The area is the site of a historic colonial fort, several restored cannons and two lighthouses, a feature peculiar to the east coast of Australia. The older Wollongong Breakwater Lighthouse located at the harbour entrance was made of wrought iron plates in 1871 and has become an icon of the city. The newer Wollongong Head Lighthouse was constructed in 1936 atop the Flagstaff Hill and is still used in the early 21st century. Belmore Basin houses the commercial fishing fleet and Fisherman's Co-op, while the main harbour shelters private vessels.

Ancestry[edit]
Legend[edit]
According to Ahom tradition, Sukaphaa was a descendant of the god Khunlung, who had come down from the heavens and had ruled Mong-Ri-Mong-Ram. Sukaphaa brings a divine diamond chum-Phra-rung-sheng-mung in a box, a divine tusked elephant, a divine chicken Kaichengmung, a divine embroidered cloth, a divine pair of drums, a divine sword Hengdan.

Prince of Mong Mao[edit]
The details of Sukaphaa's life and origins before his entry into Assam, available from different chronicles, both Ahom and non-Ahom, are full of contradictions. According to Phukan (1992) who has tried to hold up a consistent account, Sukaphaa was born to Chao Chang-Nyeu (alias Phu-Chang-Khang) and Nang-Mong Blak-Kham-Sen in the Tai state of Mong Mao (also called Mao-Lung, with the capital at Kieng Sen), close to present-day Ruili in Yunnan, China.[6] Chao Chang Nyeu was a prince from Mong-Ri Mong-Ram, who had travelled to Mong Mao possibly on an expedition.[7] Mong Mao was then ruled by Chao Tai Pung. Chao Chang Nyeu was later befriended by Pao Meo Pung, the son of the ruler, who gave his sister Blak Kham Sen in marriage. Sukaphaa was born of this union not later than 1189 CE and was brought up by his maternal grandparents.[8] Pao Meo Pung, who eventually ruled Mong Mao, had no male heir and Sukaphaa, his nephew, was nominated to succeed him. A son born late to Pao Meo Pung's queen ended Sukaphaa's claim to the throne of Mong Mao.

Departure from Mong Mao[edit]
After his 19 years as crown prince came to an end, Sukaphaa decided to leave Mong Mao. 
According to tradition, his grandmother advised him thus - ""no two tigers live in the same jungle, no two kings sit on the same throne."" Accordingly, Sukaphaa is said to have left Chieng-Sen the capital of Mong Mao in the year 1215 CE.

Journey into Assam[edit]
Sukaphaa left Mong Mao in 1215.[9] He was accompanied by three queens, two sons and a daughter; chiefs from five other dependent Mongs;[10] members of the priestly class and soldiers—a total contingent of 9,000. Some commoners are recorded as having joined this core group on the way. Sukaphaa had with him 300 horses fitted with saddles and bridles and two elephants. Heavy arms were transported along a different route.[11] Sukaphaa followed an older known route from Yunnan to Assam that passed through Myitkyina, Mogaung and the upper Irrawaddy river valley. On his way he stopped at various places and crossed the Khamjang river to reach the Nangyang lake in 1227. Here he subjugated the Nagas very ferociously and established a Mong. He left one Kan-Khrang-Mong there to guard the passage back, and proceeded to cross the Patkai hills at the Pangsau pass and reached Namrup (in the Brahmaputra valley) in December 1228. The journey, from Mong Mao to Namrup thus took Sukaphaa about thirteen years and the year he reached Namrup is considered as the year the Ahom kingdom was established.

Sukaphaa in Assam[edit]
Sukaphaa came into Assam not as a raiding conqueror but as a head  of an agriculture folk in search of land. It appear he didn't encroach upon the land of peasants, rather he opened up new areas for settlement, procuring with shrewd diplomacy what he direly needed for the purpose- the service of the local inhabitants: Come and have mutual introduction with us.You are the host, the natives of this land: we are guests coming from an up-country. You should introduce to us the local people. His appeal had the desired effect and the tribes were subsequently won over. Sukaphaa moved and lived amongst the tribesman, learnt their languages, honoured their religious rites, married their daughters and led a simple life of a commoner, himself cultivating in the land. He accepted them to his social fold, placed them on equal footing with his own men and treated them as his friends.[12]

Establishment of Ahom Kingdom[edit]
Over the next few years, he moved from place to place searching for the right capital, leaving behind his representative at each stage to rule the colonised land.  Then he went up the Burhidihing river and established a province at Lakhen Telsa.[13]  Then he came back down the river and established his rule at Tipam. In 1236 he moved to Mungklang (Abhoipur), and in 1240 down the Brahmaputra to Habung (Dhemaji).  In 1244 he went further down to Ligirigaon (Song-Tak), a few miles from present-day Nazira, and in 1246 to Simaluguri (Tun Nyeu), a place downstream from the present-day Simaluguri.[14] Finally in 1253 he built himself his capital city at Charaideo near present-day Sibsagar town.  The capital of the Ahom kingdom changed many times after this, but Charaideo remained the symbolic center of Ahom rule.
With the help of local recruits, he established three large farms for sali rice cultivation, called Barakhowakhat, Engerakhat and Gachikalakhat.[15]
In 1268 Sukaphaa died.  At the time of his death, his kingdom was bounded by the Brahmaputra River in the west, the Disang River in the north, the Dikhow River (26°58′15″N 94°38′12″E﻿ / ﻿26.970732°N 94.636745°E﻿ / 26.970732; 94.636745) in the south and the Naga Hills in the east.[14]
Even though Sukaphaa treated the people of the Patkai hills very severely on his way to the Brahmaputra valley, his approach to the population in Assam was conciliatory and non-confrontational.  He married the daughters of Badaucha, the Moran Chief and Thakumatha, the Barahi chief and established cordial relations with them.  As he began establishing his domain, he avoided regions that were heavily populated.[16]  He encouraged his soldiers as well as members of the Ahom elite to marry locally.  A process of Ahomisation (whereby locals who adopted Ahom methods of wet rice cultivation and statecraft were accepted into the Ahom fold) bolstered the process of integration.[17] The local Borahi and the Moran people, speakers of Tibeto-Burman languages, addressed Sukaphaa's people as ""Ha-Cham"", that later on developed into ""Assam"" or ""Ahom"" (see Etymology of Assam), the name of the kingdom; and ""Ahom"", the name of the people.

^ Most Buranjis attest to this version. Some Tai chronicles from outside Assam record the journey of Sukaphaa from Mong Mit (and not Mong Mao) in 1227 where he was the ruler (Gogoi 1968:253). According to this version, Sukaphaa's father had earlier divided his Mong among his three sons, and Sukaphaa became the ruler of Mong Mit about 1209. The immediate cause of departure was the aggression of Su-Khan-Pha of Mong Mao.

This Ahomisation process went on until the expanded Ahom society itself began to be Hinduised from the mid-16th century onwards."" The Ahomization of neighbors, thus, began with Sukaphaa himself.

His assistant is claimed to have accidentally touched a scalpel to the sciatic nerve of the frog and this resulted in a spark and animation of its legs.[7] This was building on the theories of Giovanni Battista Beccaria, Felice Fontana, Leopoldo Marco Antonio Caldani, and Tommaso Laghi [it].[3] Galvani was investigating the effects of distant atmospheric electricity (lightning) on prepared frog legs when he discovered the legs convulsed not only when lightning struck but also when he pressed the brass hooks attached to the frog's spinal cord to the iron railing they were suspended from.[8] In his laboratory, Galvani later discovered that he could replicate this phenomenon by touching metal electrodes of brass connected to the frog's spinal cord to an iron plate. He concluded that this was proof of ""animal electricity,"" the electric power which animated living things.[3]

His next ice time would come in relief in the next game after Comrie was injured against the New Jersey Devils.[33] Luukkonen started five out of the next seven games, with three wins, including his first NHL shutout in a 4–0 win over the Colorado Avalanche on 29 October.[34][35] Luukkonen missed three games in December due to an illness severe enough to cause him to lose weight,[36] and struggled on his return, losing his next three starts. However, Luukkonen entered the new year on a hot streak, including two consecutive shutouts on 15 and 18 January 2024, against the San Jose Sharks and Chicago Blackhawks,[37][38] becoming the first Sabres goaltender to accomplish that feat since Carter Hutton in 2019.[39] Luukkonen recorded a 33-save shutout against the Los Angeles Kings on 13 February, becoming the first Sabres goaltender since Ryan Miller in 2011–12 to record four or more shutouts in one season.[40][41] He led the league in save percentage and goals against average from 1 January until 15 February, where he missed a game due to a lower-body injury.[42][43] On 25 February, in a 3–2 shootout victory against the Carolina Hurricanes, Luukkonen would become the first Sabres goaltender since Jhonas Enroth to make four saves and allow no goals in a shootout.[44] Luukkonen notched a fifth shutout on 14 March, against the New York Islanders. He was considered ""arguably the best goalie in the league for the last while"" by teammates and media.[45][46] Luukkonen was nominated by the Professional Hockey Writers' Association (PHWA) for the 2024 Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy.[45] Luukkonen's breakout season was widely considered to be a bright spot in an otherwise disappointing Sabres season, in which the Sabres' playoff drought hit an NHL-longest 13 seasons.[47][48] Luukkonen ascribed his improvement to a positive mindset as well as the positivity of fellow goaltender Comrie,[49] while former Sabres coach Don Granato credited Luukkonen's work with Anderson as well as competing with Levi.

It is the sixth element in group 2 of the periodic table, also known as the alkaline earth metals. Pure radium is silvery-white, but it readily reacts with nitrogen (rather than oxygen) upon exposure to air, forming a black surface layer of radium nitride (Ra3N2). All isotopes of radium are radioactive, the most stable isotope being radium-226 with a half-life of 1,600 years. When radium decays, it emits ionizing radiation as a by-product, which can excite fluorescent chemicals and cause radioluminescence. For this property, it was widely used in self-luminous paints following its discovery. Of the radioactive elements that occur in quantity, radium is considered particularly toxic, and it is carcinogenic due to the radioactivity of both it and its immediate decay product radon as well as its tendency to accumulate in the bones.

In the Palearctic, the species breeds in spring (e.g. from April) but in tropical parts of its range it times breeding to coincide with rainfall. Breeding is normally in single species colonies or in small single species groups amidst mixed-species colonies of other waterbirds such as herons, egrets and cormorants. Outside the breeding season Eurasian spoonbills forage singly or in small flocks of up to 100 individuals. Migration is usually conducted in flocks of up to 100 individuals. Most activity takes place during the morning and evening (although in coastal areas foraging is governed by tidal rhythms), they often roost communally in roosts which are up to 15 km (9.3 mi) away from the feeding areas.[1]

The temperature difference is usually larger at night than during the day,[1] and is most apparent when winds are weak, under block conditions, noticeably during the summer and winter.
The main cause of the UHI effect is from the modification of land surfaces while waste heat generated by energy usage is a secondary contributor.[2][3][4] Urban areas occupy about 0.5% of the Earth's land surface but host more than half of the world's population.[5] As a population center grows, it tends to expand its area and increase its average temperature. The term heat island is also used; the term can be used to refer to any area that is relatively hotter than the surrounding, but generally refers to human-disturbed areas.[6]

This was done using the wet plate collodion process, and since the plates had to be prepared and developed (a process that required a chemically neutral setting) while the basket was aloft, Nadar experienced imaging problems as gas escaped from his balloons. After Nadar invented a gas-proof cotton cover and draped it over his balloon baskets, he was able to capture stable images.[7]: 159  He also pioneered the use of artificial lighting in photography, working in the catacombs of Paris.

Ndzwani was generally ruled by a single sultan, who occasionally attempted to extend his authority to Mayotte and Mwali; Ngazidja was more fragmented, on occasion being divided into as many as 12 small kingdoms.

The programme was filmed live at Electric Haze bar in Worcester, Massachusetts and aired on streaming service IndependentWrestling.tv. In contrast to ""traditional"" weekly professional wrestling shows, promoter Drew Cordeiro stated the intention of the show was to capture the feel and atmosphere of Independent style professional wrestling and thus would focus primarily on in-ring action rather than speaking segments.[2] Seasons typically revolved around wrestlers attempting to secure enough wins to advance to the Beyond Wrestling event Heavy Lies the Crown, held each year at the end of December.

After he moved his workshops to the site, the premises were used for weaving, dyeing, and creating stained glass; within three years, 100 craftsmen were employed there.[149] Working conditions at the Abbey were better than at most Victorian factories. However, despite Morris's ideals, there was little opportunity for the workers to display their own individual creativity.[150] Morris had initiated a system of profit sharing among the Firm's upper clerks, however this did not include the majority of workers, who were instead employed on a piecework basis. Morris was aware that, in retaining the division between employer and employed, the company failed to live up to his own egalitarian ideals, but he defended this, asserting that it was impossible to run a socialist company within a competitive capitalist economy.[151] The Firm itself was expanding, opening up a store in Manchester in 1883 and holding a stand at that year's Foreign Fair in Boston.[152]

"Dunningen,_Rathaus.jpg",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Dunningen%2C_Rathaus.jpg/250px-Dunningen%2C_Rathaus.jpg,Dunningen," Seedorf Ortsmitte Dunningen (Swabian: Dunninga) is a town in the district of Rottweil, in Baden-Württemberg, Germany.
 
Dunningen[edit]
Geography[edit]
Dunningen is located at the centre of the administrative district of Rottweil in the south western part of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany. The village is located in the shell limestone area between the Black Forest and the Swabian Alps on a  strip of open country that crosses the district from north to south and that is mainly used for agriculture.
It is located on the eastern slope of the central part of the Black Forest, which borders on the Oberen Gäuen in the west.
From an infrastructural perspective, Dunningen is located advantageously on the B462, which is the main road  between Schramberg and Rottweil.
Switzerland, as well as Lake Constance, can be reached in one hour, Austria in two hours by car. The French region of Alsace lies to the east and is also within easy reach.
The Eschach, which is a tributary of the Neckar, passes through Seedorf [de], Lackendorf and Dunningen.

Neighbouring communities and districts[edit]
Dunningen shares the municipal boundaries with Waldmössingen, Beffendorf, Bösingen, Villingendorf, Hochwald, Zimmerm ob Rottweil, Eschbronn and Sulgen.
Administratively, Waldmössingen and Sulgen, which are located in northern and western direction, are part of the city of Schramberg, whereas Hochwald in southern and Beffendorf in northern direction, belong respectively to the towns of Rottweil and Oberndorf.
The municipality consists of three districts which are Dunningen, Seedorf and Lackendorf. The district of Dunningen includes the village itself, the villers Auf der Stampfe and Frohnhof, the farms Eichhof, Gifizenmoos, Stittholz, Staudenrain and Beckenwäldle and the dwelling place Hindenburg. The districts of Lackendorf and Seedorf include, in each case, the two villages themselves.[3]

History[edit]
The foundation of the village dates back to the Romans, as a Roman road and a Villa Rustica - a Roman farm - were found in the area. Moreover, there is proof of a Roman fort in the neighbouring village of Waldmössingen.
Dunningen was first mentioned  in a deed of gift from Count Gerold (+799) to the monastery of St. Gallen in 786. The village was independent until it became part of the imperial city of Rottweil in 1435.
After the Principal Decree of the Imperial Deputation in 1803, the village became part of Württemberg and was integrated into the newly created city district of Rottweil.
Dunningen Castle, which was built in the 11th century, has disappeared completely.
In the course of the administrative reform that took place in Baden-Wurttemberg in the seventies, the municipalities of Lackendorf and Seedorf were incorporated into Dunningen,  on 1 August 1972 and 1 January 1974 respectively.
In earlier times, Seedorf was administrated by the imperial city of Rottweil and was handed over to the city of Oberndorf after mediation in the course of the Principal Decree of the Imperial Deputation. After the latter was resolved in 1938, the village was passed over to the district of Rottweil.

Religion[edit]
Even after the Reformation, Dunningen remained Roman Catholic. Up to today, only the church congregation of St. Martin possesses a catholic pastorate. The few Protestant inhabitants are incorporated into the Protestant church parish of the neighbouring village of Eschbronn.

Educational institutions[edit]
Dunningen offers several types of secondary school (Realschule) and a primary school located in Seedorf. Grammar schools (Gymnasium) can be attended in Schramberg and Rottweil, while each of the three municipalities has its own kindergarten. The so-called ""Dunninger Forum"" is an adult education institution that also operates in the area.
Furthermore, there is a music school and an art school for children and teenagers in Dunningen.

Sports[edit]
The sports clubs of Dunningen and its municipalities are FC Dunningen (Football), TSV Dunningen (handball and gymnastics), TC Dunningen (tennis), TTV Dunningen (table tennis), Shooting Club Dunningen, SpVgg Stetten-Lackendorf 1963, SV Seedorf (football, skiing, handball) and TTC Seedorf (table tennis). The SV Seedorf has the most members of all the clubs in the municipality of Dunningen. Apart from the more classical sporting activities like football, gymnastics and handball, the clubs offer various leisure sport activities including volleyball, rhythmic gymnastics, badminton and dancing. The Skiclub Seedorf e. V. that has its own ski hut, ""the SCS- Alpenhaus"", in Braz/Austria for friends of skiing.

Culture and sights[edit]
The Museum of local history
The museum of local history, which is located in Dunningen town hall, illustrates the lives of famous sons and daughters of the village, for example Emil Maier, Landolin Ohnmachtand Jacob Maier. Maier was a politician of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, during the times of the German Empire and the Weimar Republic, and became the Home Secretary of Baden some years later. At the level of local politics, he was particularly active in Mannheim and Heidelberg.
Another part of the museum is dedicated to the classical artist Landolin Ohmacht (1760-1834). From 1803, he lived and worked primarily in Strasbourg where he created important monuments of popular personalities of the city and the region. His most famous work shows Susette Gontard, the wife of a Frankfurt banker, who is known in literary history as Hölderlin's Diotima.[4] The third exhibition portrays the life and work of Jakob Mayer, who invented a technique to cast steel in moulds in the 1840s. Apart from bells, he produced iron rails and wheels. In cooperation with Eduard Kühne, Mayer founded the Bochum Association of Mining and Cast Steel Production. Their greatest competitor was the Krupp company in Essen. Mayer was born in Dunningen in 1813 and died in Bochum in 1875 where he has an honorary grave in Kortum Park.
The museum is open on the first Sunday of the month from 2 pm to 5 pm.

He formed the short-lived Hui Kuokoa Party. However, by September 1, 1902, Kuhio decided to join the Republican Party, was nominated as their candidate for Congress, and dramatically altered the political landscape.  Election day, November 4, 1902, proved to be devastating to the Home Rule Party.  Republicans won 26 legislative seats, the Home Rulers 9, and the Democrats one.

Lynn Margulis and K. V. Schwartz placed chaetognaths in the deuterostomes in their Five Kingdom classification.[27] However, several developmental features are at odds with deuterostomes and are either akin to Spiralia or unique to Chaetognatha.[3]

Rose attended the University of Michigan where the Wolverines reached two NCAA Finals games in 1992 and 1993, finishing as national runners up both times. Rose was a part of Wolverines coach Steve Fisher's legendary 1991 recruiting class, dubbed the ""Fab Five"".

She was the first woman of Louisiana to speak publicly in behalf of women. She addressed the State convention in 1879, and assisted to secure an article in the Constitution making all women over 21 years of age eligible to hold office in connection with the public schools. It required considerable moral courage to side with a movement so cruelly derided in the South, but, supported by her husband, she always worked for the emancipation of women through her writing, defining the legal status of woman in Louisiana. She was a valued correspondent of several leading woman's journals. In 1888, she represented Louisiana in the Woman's International Council in Washington D.C., and also in the Woman's Suffrage Association, which immediately afterward held a convention in the same city.[1]

Significant exchange with Malus sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted in populations of apples being more related to crabapples than to the more morphologically similar progenitor Malus sieversii. In strains without recent admixture the contribution of the latter predominates.[27][28][29]

Leopold, who received the territory as a reward for his fidelity to Emperor Otto II during the uprising of Duke Henry II of Bavaria, extended its area down the Danube river into what is today Lower Austria at the expense of the retreating Magyars.

The compositional structures followed discrete movement patterns emulating the style of John Fahey, whom McDonald admired.[21] Though Electric Music for the Mind and Body was among the most complex works to date, it possessed the quality that several other San Francisco acts shared of being recorded mostly live, with only the vocals being overdubbed after the instrumentals were completed.[23]

Deliverance's 1990 music video for the title track of Weapons of Our Warfare album received some airplay on MTV. Allmusic wrote about Believer's Sanity Obscure album: ""Before 1990, the Christian heavy metal genre rarely strayed from generic riffing and poor lyrics. Bands like Petra and Sacred Warrior never broke through to the mainstream for this very reason. With low expectations, Believer released this massive slab of molten metal. Although it never really became popular, several mainstream magazines praised the album.""[83]

Typically a Hindu temple[1] prayer hall is generally built in front of the temple's sanctum sanctorum (garbhagriha).[2] Usually large Hindu temples have one or more prakarams.[3] The Prakaram acts as circumambulatory passage to the devotees to come around the sanctum. Based on the size of the temple, there can be more than one Prakaram with the smaller one enclosed within the larger.[4] As per Hindu religious practices, devotees start to come around the outer prakarams to the inner most before entering the sanctum. This is indicative of the belief that the devotees have to lose the outermost bondage to the inner most one before attaining divinity. The method is also indicative of reduction of noises in the outer space to the inner most to increase communiion with god.[5] Ramanathaswamy Temple has outer set of corridors is reputed to be the longest in the world, measuring about 6.9 m in height, 400 feet each in the east and west and about 640 feet in the north and the south.

Although the single cylinder Ossa had 20 horsepower (15 kW) less than the powerful V4 Yamahas of Phil Read and Bill Ivy, the Ossa was 45 pounds (20 kg) lighter and its monocoque frame was much stiffer, giving it superior agility.[2][3][5] Herrero was able to take advantage of the Ossa's light weight and superior handling characteristics to remain competitive, especially on tighter race tracks.[3][5][6] The Yamahas swept the championship, but Herrero's results left no doubt that the little Ossa was quick and dependable.

Herrero crashed at the 13th milestone (Westwood Corner), losing control of his motorcycle on melted tar during the sixth and final lap of the 250cc Lightweight TT.[2] Despite a previous setback at Braddan Bridge when he went up the slip road and crashed, breaking his windscreen, he had battled back up to third place.[9] Stan Woods, who had originally been reported to have collided with Herrero, actually crashed while trying to avoid him.[2][9][10] As a result of the accident, Woods suffered a broken ankle and two broken collar-bones.[11] Herrero died of irreversible shock and from his injuries two days later.[2] He was 27 years old. The cause of the accident, described by Stanley Woods, ""may have been melting tar on the bend.""[10] His loss affected the Ossa factory so much that they abandoned road racing altogether.[2][4]

Those have a basis in ancient societies such as ancient Rome and the Anglo-Saxons.[22] In contrast, Tolkien placed the Shire in a society he had personally experienced, ""more or less a Warwickshire village of about the period of the Diamond Jubilee [of Queen Victoria, in 1897]"".[22][T 19] Shippey described hobbit culture, complete with tobacco and potatoes,[23] as a ""creative anachronism"" on Tolkien's part.[24] In his view, anachronism is the ""essential function"" of hobbits, enabling Tolkien to ""bridge the gap"" by mediating between readers' lives in the modern world and the dangerous ancient world of Middle-earth.[23]

Family background and education[edit]
Niculescu was born into a family of educated lăutari. Everybody in his family was involved in music: his father and his uncle were violinists, his mother a pianist and his sister a cellist. He received his first violin lessons from his father, with whom he started to study seriously when he was 4–5 years old. At 6 he enrolled at the Dinu Lipatti Music School and then at George Enescu Music High School where he was a first prize student. He played with his father at weddings and celebrations and developed his improvisation skills. When he was about 13 he heard violinist Stéphane Grappelli, who would become his idol and jazz his main attraction.

Career[edit]
In 1991 he left for Paris to fulfill his dream of meeting Grappelli and making a name in jazz. He got his first gig at a Russian cabaret. He enrolled in the Conservatoire de Paris, although his jazz teacher told him from the first audition that he shouldn't waste his time and should be playing on stage. He continued to play on various scenes with various musicians.
Niculescu met Grappelli in 1994. Grappelli proposed they record an album, but Niculescu declined, believing that he didn't deserve the honor. He hoped to receive some lessons from Grappelli but Grappelli told him that he has nothing to teach him as the Romani had a fantastic natural technique.[2] In 1995 he joined Romane's band, and in 2001 he was invited by Biréli Lagrène to join his Gipsy Project inspired by the Quintette du Hot Club de France.
He has worked with Roberto Alagna, Charles Aznavour, Marcel Azzola, George Benson, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Patrick Bruel, Regina Carter, Angelo Debarre, Angela Gheorghiu, Johnny Hallyday, Hot Club de Norvège, Patricia Kaas, Jon Larsen, Giani Lincan, Wynton Marsalis, John McLaughlin, Oscar Peterson, Bucky Pizzarelli, Babik Reinhardt, Jimmy Rosenberg, Henri Salvador, and Tchavolo Schmitt. Violinist Scott Tixier was Niculescu only student when he was 15 years old in Paris.

They are typically composed of blue-green cyanobacteria and sediments. Formation occurs when alternating layers of blue-green bacteria and sediments are deposited or grow in place, creating dark-laminated layers. Stromatolites are prime examples of algal mats. Algal mats played an important role in the Great Oxidation Event on Earth some 2.3 billion years ago. Algal mats can become a significant ecological problem, if the mats grow so expansive or thick as to disrupt the other underwater marine life by blocking the sunlight or producing toxic chemicals.

Matteo_Egizio.jpg,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Matteo_Egizio.jpg/220px-Matteo_Egizio.jpg,Matteo_Egizio," Matteo Egizio (23 January 1674[1]– 29 November 1745[1]) was an Italian historian, librarian, numismatist and scholar.
 
Life[edit]
He was born in Naples to a family that had originated in Gravina di Puglia. His father worked for the noblewoman Maria Milano, who encouraged Egizio towards studying classics. He then studied law, the subject in which he graduated. From a young age he divided his time between private tuition and attending Giuseppe Valletta's library, editing its catalogue.[1]
He then became tutor to Antonio Carmine Caracciolo, prince of Torella, simultaneously becoming known for his knowledge of antiquities, so much so that he was often called on to interpret ancient coins and inscriptions and compose new inscriptions. He corresponded with  Anton Francesco Gori, Scipione Maffei, Apostolo Zeno, Bernard de Montfaucon and other intellectuals of the era[2] as well as joining Naples' Accademia degli Uniti and (with the pseudonym Timaste Pisandeo) Rome's Accademia dell'Arcadia and writing for the 'Giornale dei letterati'.
He moved in libertine and anticurialist circles[1] but supported Naples' Bourbon rulers, leaving Naples after the Austrians' arrival in 1713 and moving to Amalfi. He later returned to live an isolated life in Naples, where he later died.

On 1 October 1910 the parish was abolished and merged with South Manchester.[18] In 1901 the parish had a population of 11,485.[19] Prior to the turn of the 20th century West Levenshulme was considered to be a ""dormitory"" for Manchester. This description eventually changed to one of ""residential suburb"" a decade or so later, but East Levenshulme was still primarily industrial in nature consisting mostly of print works, bleach works, dye works and mattress works. In spite of the preponderance of industrial works there were also several farms, and the area around what is now Levenshulme High School was considered to be semi-rural until the 1920s.[7]

This resulted in mass protests at the Wisconsin State Capitol, which continued for months.  Responding to public pressure and unable to slow down the legislative consideration of the bill, Taylor fled the state with 13 other Democratic state senators in order to deny a quorum.  The situation received national attention, and Taylor was a frequent guest on progressive political talk shows, appearing several times on The Ed Show.[16]  During the course of debate, Taylor made statements comparing Walker's proposed legislation to Adolf Hitler's plan to eliminate unions.[17] On her Twitter account she wrote ""LIKE HITLER in 1933, WALKER is busting unions.""[18][19]

Biography[edit]
Early career[edit]
The historic Malabadi Bridge was built by Husam al-Din Timurtash.
The main sources of his reign were the chronicle of Ibn al-Azraq al-Fariqi and Ibn al-Athir, in addition to Michael the Syrian, Ibn al-Furat, Al-Azimi, and Ibn al-Adim.
His first task, still very young, was in 1111/12, when he was sent as ambassador to the Seljuk sultan Muhammad I Tapar to intercede for the fate of Dubais ibn Sadaqa. He then accompanied his father, Ilghazi, to Aleppo in 1118 and remained in the city temporarily as governor while his father went to Mardin to seek reinforcements.
On the death of his father in 1122, on his way to Mayyafariqin, Timurtash had the government of Mardin, while his brother Shams al-Dawla Suleiman became ruler of Mayyafariqin. When his cousin Belek Ghazi died during the siege of Manbij on 6 May 1124, Timurtash, who had accompanied him, took his dead body back to Aleppo on the next day,[2] hence he became the ruler of the city.
Timurtash decided to free Baldwin II of Jerusalem, whom Belek had taken prisoner.[3] Timurtash entrusted Sultan, the emir of Shaizar, with commencing negotiations for Baldwin's release with his family.[3] According to their agreement, Baldwin was to pay 80,000 dinars and to cede Atarib, Zardana, Azaz and other Antiochene fortresses to Timurtash.[3][4] Baldwin also promised that he would assist Timurtash against the Bedouin warlord, Dubais ibn Sadaqa.[3][4] After a quarter of Baldwin's ransom was paid and a dozen hostages (including Baldwin's youngest daughter Ioveta and Joscelin II) were handed over to Timurtash to secure the payment of the balance, Baldwin was released on 29 August 1124.[5][3]
However, Timurtash was later defeated on the outskirts of Aleppo by forces loyal to the local Seljuk Sultan-Shah, and emir Dubais ibn Sadaqa, now allies of the Crusaders. Timurtash, with very little support,[a] fled in August 1124 to Mardin, while in Aleppo the local qadi Ibn al-Khashshab came to power nominally in the name of Timurtash.
Timurtash asked for help from his brother Suleiman of Mayyafariqin in September 1124, but the two brothers did not get along and Aleppo was left to its own fate. Suleiman died in Mayyafariqin, late 1124 or late 1130, and Timurtash was recognized in that city.
In 1125, the qadi of Aleppo sent an embassy demanding Timurtash's return during the Siege of Aleppo, but he imprisoned the ambassadors, apparently irritated by their complaints.[6] They escaped and then the embassy went to Aqsunqur al-Bursuqi, the atabeg of Mosul, who was offered the government, which he soon took possession of and ruled for a time until he was assassinated by the Order of Assassins in November 1126.

Interactions with Zengi[edit]
“Sign of Sagittarius” by al-Sufi in his book Ṣuwar al-kawākib al-thābita, Artuqid Mardin, 1131 CE.[7]
When Imad al-Din Zengi became the atabeg of Mosul, he laid siege to Nusaybin, which belonged to Timurtash, who asked for help from his cousin Rukn al-Dawla Da'ud, and promised him to rule the city. Zengi intercepted a messenger pigeon sent by Timurtash to the governor of Nusaybin, and replaced the message by getting the garrison to surrender to his forces.[8] This success of Zengi, followed in 1128 by the conquest of Aleppo, forced the Artuqid emirs to ally with each other and with other Turkmen emirs.
In 1130, an alliance was signed with Ilaldi, the ruler of Amida, and other Turkmen chiefs against Zengi; but the combined army was defeated by Zengi at Saruj, and the atabeg occupied the city along with Dara.[8] The alliance with Timurtash came to an end and each of them again dealt with his internal affairs, with Timurtash accepting Zengi's hegemony.[9]
In 1134, Zengi became involved in Artuqid affairs, allying with Timurtash against his cousin Da'ud, in which they clashed with Da'ud on the outskirts of Amida, and Da'ud was defeated; Zengi occupied al-Sur fortress which he handed over to Timurtash along with other smaller sites.[9] Once Zengi left Amida, Da'ud, angry at the lost territories, launched a campaign against his cousin which forced him to demolish the suburbs of Mayyafariqin, as he thought that he could not maintain these parts against the depredations of his rival.[10]
After 1136, Timurtash distanced himself from Zengi. In 1136/37, he conquered Hattakh, the last Marwanid fortress in Amida; then some members of the Marwanite family appeared in his service. In 1138/39, the Zengid governor of Nusaybin, Abu-Bakr, who was threatened by Zengi fled to the principality of Timurtash and sought asylum. Zengi demanded the surrender of the fugitive and Timurtash refused. Then the atabeg went to Mardin and Timurtash only got away by giving him Dara and his daughter for marriage; hence, according to Ibn al-Azraq, he avoided the surrender of Abu Bakr.[11]
In 1141/42, he reached an agreement with his cousin Rukn al-Dawla Da'ud. In the meantime, Zengi asked Timurtash to send a commander named Habashi, a request for unknown reasons, which ended with Habashi's assassination in Zengi's camp.[12] It seemed that the Emir of Mardin was seeking an alliance with Da'ud and Joscelin II, Count of Edessa which was opposed by Zengi. Other reasons for the conflict were known, as according to Ibn al-Athir, a large group of peasants left Mosul to settle in Mardin; Zengi asked for their return but Timurtash refused and said that he only charged them a tenth of the harvest, and that if Zengi had done the same they would not have left. Zengi argued that without his assistance, Timurtash would not avoid the conquest of the city by the Crusaders; which urged him eventually to return the peasants.
In 1144, his cousin Rukn al-Dawla Da'ud died, and Zengi seized almost all of his territories between Hasankeyf and Harput. The attempt to ally Kara Arslan, Da'ud's son and successor, with Timurtash and the Count of Edessa ended with Zengi's conquest of the county capital. In 1145/46, Zengi advanced against Mayyafariqin but withdrew, as it was probably nothing more than a show of strength. The assassination of Zengi in Qal'at Ja'bar in 1146 settled the matter.[12]
Immediately upon learning of the atabeg's death, Timurtash went out with his Turkmen and occupied some territories such as Hani and Siwan before Zengi's successor in Mosul, his son Sayf al-Din Ghazi I, could establish his power.[13] Timurtash occupied Siirt in 1146 then handed it over a year later to Kara Arslan.

Later years[edit]
In 1148/49, Timurtash suffered a serious defeat against Saif al-Din Ghazi of Mosul who reached as far as Mardin with the intention of reclaiming all the territories of his father; before achieving anything decisive he died in 1149 in Mosul. Shortly afterwards the Emir of Amida, Kara Arslan, recognized the sovereignty of the Emir of Mardin, then around 1150 he conquered Samsat when the Count of Edessa, Joscelin II, was taken prisoner by Nur al-Din.[14] Shortly before his death, Timurtash received in 1152 from the Caliph, Al-Muqtafi, dresses and diplomas accrediting the Caliphate's recognition of his possessions.
He died in 1154,[15] and was succeeded by his son Najm al-Din Alpi.

Notes[edit]


^ Even his cousin, Badr al-Dawla Suleiman, who had been governor of Aleppo from 1122 to 1123, and who felt humiliated for being removed from office by Belek, did not side with him.

The Jain texts are dated variously, but generally pre-500 CE, most likely sometime within the first five centuries of the common era.[37] Moriz Winternitz states that the Valmiki Ramayana was already famous before it was recast in the Jain Paumacariya poem, dated to the second half of the 1st century CE, which pre-dates a similar retelling found in the Buddha-carita of Asvagosa, dated to the beginning of the 2nd century CE or prior.[38]

Subsequently, the squadron flew to join HMS Ark Royal near Malta in November. By the time of the Kuwait crisis in June 1961, the squadron was aboard the lead ship of her class, HMS Centaur, and it later operated in both the Far East and the Mediterranean regions before transferring to HMS Victorious in August 1963. This vessel then embarked on an extended deployment to the Far East, which included stops in Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines, and Australia. During a period of heightened tensions with Indonesia, the squadron was placed on alert and disembarked at RAF Tengah, Singapore, from June to August 1964 while the ship underwent refitting in HMNB Singapore.

Matthews scored another hat trick the following game in a 7–4 Leafs victory over the Minnesota Wild, becoming the first player to score back-to-back hat tricks at the start of the season since Ovechkin achieved the feat in the first two games of the 2017–18 season in October 2017.[104] Matthews was elected one of four team captains to draft a team in the 2024 All-Star Game hosted in Toronto in February 2024. Team captains were paired alongside celebrities at that year's All-Star Game tournament; Matthews was paired up with alternate captain Rielly and Canadian pop singer Justin Bieber. In the first game, Team Matthews played against Team Hughes, where they claimed victory after a shootout. Moving on to the finals against Team McDavid, the two teams were tied after one period, but Team Matthews dominated the second half of the match as they won the tournament. Matthews was awarded the All-Star Game MVP, becoming the fifth Maple Leaf to capture the award overall, and the first in 33 years to do so.[105] Matthews continued to score at a torrid pace as the season went on. By the end of the Maple Leafs' 54th game of the season on February 21, 2024 against the Arizona Coyotes, Matthews had already climbed to 51 goals with a two-goal game, by far the fastest pace to reach the 50-goal mark by an American player. The previous record pace for an American player to score 50 was 62 games, set by Kevin Stevens with the 1992–93 Pittsburgh Penguins.[106] On March 30, 2024, he became the ninth player in NHL history to have multiple 60-goal seasons as the Leafs defeated the Buffalo Sabres 3–0.[107] He recorded his 100th point of the season with his 64th goal of the season against the Montreal Canadiens, marking the second 100-point season of his career, on April 6, 2024;[108] three nights later, he broke Ovechkin's salary cap-era record by scoring his 66th goal in a 5–2 win over the New Jersey Devils, securing the distinction of being the first NHL player in 28 years to score more than 65 goals in a single season. The last time such an accomplishment was achieved was during the 1995-96 NHL season by Mario Lemieux, who scored 69 goals that season, as Matthews would go on to match Lemieux's accomplishment by scoring a total of 69 goals as the season drew to a close and capturing his third career Rocket Richard Trophy.[109] Matthews would also record a goal and three assists for four points in five games as the Maple Leaf would get ousted once more in the opening round of the 2024 playoffs in seven games to the Boston Bruins.

P-38 pilot Warren Lewis quoted Lindbergh's fuel-saving settings, ""He said, '... we can cut the RPM down to 1400 RPMs and use 30 inches of mercury (manifold pressure), and save 50–100 gallons of fuel on a mission.'""[249] The U.S. Marine and Army Air Force pilots who served with Lindbergh praised his courage and defended his patriotism.[246][250]

Maragha, Persia, 1297-1299. Morgan Library & Museum (Ms. M.500).[21] The ancient Persian religion of Manichaeism made considerable use of images; not only was the founding prophet Mani (c.216–276) a professional artist, at least according to later Islamic tradition, but one of the sacred books of the religion, the Arzhang, was illustrated by the prophet himself, whose illustrations (probably essentially cosmological diagrams rather than images with figures) were regarded as part of the sacred material and always copied with the text. Unfortunately, the religion was repressed strongly from the Sassanid era and onwards so that only tiny fragments of Manichean art survive. These no doubt influenced the continuing Persian tradition, but little can be said about how. It is also known that Sassanid palaces had wall-paintings, but only fragments of these have survived.[24]

The jackets were made out of horsehide, had a belted front, D-pocket, flap change pocket, zippered sleeve cuffs and shoulder epaulettes. This classic motorcycle jacket was a double-breasted design which meant that the left front panel ( with the left side of the main zipper on the front edge ) overlaps the right front panel ( which has the other side of the zipper located a couple of inches in ). This creates a windproof seal while riding, when zipped up.

As the historian Eugene Rogan has written, ""the single greatest threat to the independence of the Middle East"" in the 19th century ""was not the armies of Europe but its banks"".[135] The Ottoman state, which had begun taking on debt with the Crimean War, was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1875.[136] By 1881, the Ottoman Empire agreed to have its debt controlled by the Ottoman Public Debt Administration, a council of European men with presidency alternating between France and Britain. The body controlled swaths of the Ottoman economy, and used its position to ensure that European capital continued to penetrate the empire, often to the detriment of local Ottoman interests.[136]

On Yeonpyeong-ri, an island near Incheon where many haenyeo worked, their wages, on average, constituted 40 to 48 percent of a typical family's total income.[9] The prominent place of haenyeo in Jeju's economy and in their individual family units continued long after Japanese colonization. In the early 1960s, for example, haenyeo harvests accounted for 60% of Jeju's fisheries revenue, and 40% of haenyeo husbands remained unemployed.[4][8]

He continued as president pro tempore until a state constitutional amendment in 1979 separated the offices of Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin and President of the Senate.  When the amendment was certified on May 1, 1979, Risser was elected president of the Senate and the office of president pro tempore became defunct for a number of years.  Risser held the office of president of the Senate continuously for the next 16 years, until Democrats lost the majority in the 1994 election.  He was returned to the office of president every time the Democrats held the majority in the subsequent 20 years.  In total, he served about 26 years as president of the Senate.[1]

In 1982, she published a book Un giorno a Bebedija (One Day in Bébédjia), which reflected on the impact of world hunger and political stability.[20] Poland awarded Fanfani a second Meritorious Activist of Culture Medal in 1983.[19] To further her ability to help others, Fanfani became president of the Women's Committee of the Italian Red Cross in 1983 and a vice president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in 1985, serving a four-year term.[14] In 1985, she formed a foundation Sempre Insieme per la Pace (Always Together For Peace) to expand her humanitarian efforts,[21] funding the organization by selling all of her personal jewelry with the exception of her wedding ring.[15] She chartered a peace ship in conjunction with the Red Cross, which circumnavigated the African continent bringing food and medicines to Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, Senegal, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo and Uganda. When the ship arrived back in Tunis in October, it was loaded with additional supplies to take medicine, clothing, and prefabricated buildings to the victims of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake.[22]

The late Viscount was childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the 6th Viscount. The latter was succeeded by his son, the 7th Viscount. The 7th Viscount was also created Baron Bulkeley, of Beaumaris, in the County of Anglesey, in the Peerage of Great Britain on 14 May 1784, which entitled him to a seat in the House of Lords. In 1802 he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Warren, which was that of his father-in-law, Sir George Warren. On his death in 1822 both titles became extinct. Sir Richard Williams, of Penrhyn, succeeded to the Bulkeley estates and assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Bulkeley.

Biography[edit]
Thomas was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, United States, on June 19, 1909.[2] His first band job was with the Earl Hood Orchestra. After eight months Horace Henderson offered him a job.[3] Thomas played alto sax under Hood and Henderson, but played tenor from the time he joined Stuff Smith's band in 1932.[2]
Thomas played with Jimmie Lunceford's band from 1933 until the leader's death in 1947, often soloing and occasionally singing.[2] After Lunceford died, Thomas and Ed Wilcox co-led his ghost band until Thomas left to form his own septet. This band, containing trumpeter Johnny Grimes, trombonist Dicky Harris, baritone saxophonist Ben Kynard, pianist George Rhodes, bassist George Duvivier, and drummer Joe Marshall, recorded between 1949 and 1951.[2]
Thomas then left the music industry to work for his family's undertaking business.[2] He played occasionally, including at the 1970 Newport Jazz Festival, and recorded again under his own name in 1979.[2] Three years later Thomas also recorded with a septet that included Grimes, Harris, and Duvivier from his band three decades earlier.[2]
Thomas died in Kansas City, Missouri on August 3, 1986.[2] Material from his career is held by the University of Missouri–Kansas City.[2]

Playing style and influence[edit]
Thomas's inspirations on saxophone were Coleman Hawkins and Chu Berry. As a soloist, he did not stray far from the melody and chose to emphasise rhythm.[2] Grove Music commented that ""His huge and occasionally grainy tone influenced an entire generation of saxophonists in the 1940s"".[2]

This was quite different later in 1918 with the French top ace René Fonck, who despite having 75 confirmed victories, had bad publicity for his arrogance and shameless self-promotion.

Miller prevailed in the primary over Monona attorney Helen Marks Dicks, Madison city budget analyst Dan Bohrod, and Madison activist Barbara Pennington. In the general election, he faced Republican Madison consultant Kevin Miller, and won 68% of the vote in the Democrat-friendly district. Miller was re-elected in his Assembly seat in 2000 and 2002, and continued his education during this time, attending the Bowhay Institute for Legislative Leadership Development and the Flemming Fellows Leadership Institute.

The Pacers won the series 4–2, with second star Damian Lillard also missing time for the Bucks.[138] In the conference semifinals, the Pacers faced the 2nd seed New York Knicks.[139] The Knicks had their own injury issues, with starting forward Julius Randle and role-player Bojan Bogdanovic set to miss the series. The Knicks won game 1 after a series of controversial officiating decisions in the final minute, before also winning game 2, in which they lost OG Anunoby to injury. The Pacers responded by winning games 3 and 4 at home, before the teams traded home wins in games 5 and 6.

They spent the remainder of the 1980s touring and establishing their reputation. Their breakthrough came in 1990 when band member Marie Nilsson Lind collaborated with former ABBA member Benny Andersson to write several songs, with Andersson providing the music for Lind's lyrics. The first single issued, ""Jag mötte Lassie"", with its touching lyrics about a lonely little girl, struck a chord with record buyers and became the Christmas/New Year #1 on the Swedish singles chart. The follow-up, ""Älska mej"", also sold well and both tracks remain popular.

The overseer or creator of more than three thousand woodcuts, engravings and paintings in various mediums, Rubens's works include historical, religious and allegorical paintings, altarpieces, portraits and landscapes.[17]  He is particularly known for his portrayal of human figures, lush and richly colored fabrics and well-developed themes often derived from both Christian and classical traditions.[18]   Rubens's studies of classical, Greek, and Latin texts influenced his career and set him apart from other painters during his time.[19] Early in his career, Rubens studied under Flemish artists such as Otto van Veen,[20] but his most notable influences come from the time he spent in Italy where he studied ancient sculpture and the works of Michelangelo, Raphael, Caravaggio, Titian, and Veronese. It was during his time in Italy that he began to make copies of classical sculpture, such as the Laocoön Group, and collect drawings done by other artists.  However, the artist was also an avid collector of both reproductions and original works, not only from the masters of the Italian Renaissance, but more predominantly from his contemporaries.  Rubens owned more prints from his contemporary, Adriaen Brouwer, than any other of his Italian influences or his own contemporaries, although it is suggested that Rubens's compassion and concern for Brouwer's career may have been the influential cause for his collection of Brouwer's work.[21]  This record of visual history and the influences of his contemporaries, some who became lifelong friends of Rubens, would make an imprint on his art throughout his entire life.[22]

Paintings of the Greek goddess of love Aphrodite (Venus to the Romans) often portray her as sexual and fertile. Hesiod's Theogony states that Aphrodire (Venus) was born from the sperm/foam of the castrated genitals of Uranus. Venus Anadyomene is a painting by Apelles that shows Aphrodite rising from the sea. The original painting is now lost, but a colossal copy of the painting exists, painted by the artist Titian and known as Venus Anadyomene by Titian. It depicts Venus (Aphrodite) rising from the sea and wringing her wet hair after her birth, a pose inspired by an account of the original painting by Apelles.[5][6] Demeter, the Greek goddess of agriculture, grain crops, fertility and motherly relationships is often shown carrying a basket of apples in sculptures, which are meant to show fertility.[2]

Dowling_066.jpg,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Dowling_066.jpg/220px-Dowling_066.jpg,Alice_Springs," World War II brought significant changes to Alice Springs. Prior to the war, Alice Springs was an isolated settlement of fewer than 500 people. During the war, however, the town was an extremely active staging base, known as No. 9 Australian Staging Camp, and a depot base for the long four-day trip to Darwin. The railway hub in Alice Springs was taken over by military operations, and the number of soldiers posted in Alice Springs grew rapidly, as did the number of personnel passing through on their way to and from Darwin. When Darwin was threatened by Japanese forces, the sea routes—the Northern Territory capital's primary means of transportation and resupply—were cut off. The evacuation of Darwin first brought a large number of civilians including elected officials and many of the territory government's records. Alice Springs became the war-time civilian capital of the Northern Territory. When Darwin was bombed by Japanese air forces, a large number of military personnel and their heavy equipment were rapidly moved south to Alice Springs.

Life[edit]
Soledad Juliana Villafranca Los Arcos was born in the Spanish Navarre town of Agoitz in 1878[1] or 1880[2] or 1876.[3] She was the fifth of nine children to José Maria and Josefa,[1] a wealthy,[3] progressive, freethinking family from small towns in Navarre. Her father ran the prison in Agoitz and fought in the Navarre Guard during the Third Carlist War. When he died in 1885, Villafranca's mother moved the family to the agrarian city Pamplona but when there was not enough to make ends meet, the family split to try other cities.[1] Villafranca moved in 1902 to Barcelona,[2] where two of her sisters socialized and married in the city's radical and anarchist community.[4]
In Barcelona, Villafranca and her sisters met Francisco Ferrer, who had founded the secular, rationalist Escuela Moderna school. Villafranca became romantically involved with Ferrer and taught in the school's elementary program.[5]
The school's librarian, Mateu Morral, might have attempted to kill the king in 1906 as an expression of his frustrated love for her.[3] He had sent her a letter prior to the bombing attentat that raised suspicion of Villafranca as a potential co-conspirator alongside Ferrer. She testified that she had no role in the attack.[5]
Freed from implication in the event, Villafranca accompanied Ferrer during his 1907–1909 exile, where they spread anarchist propaganda across Europe.[2][3] They visited multiple European cities including Antwerp and Paris, telling the story of their persecution and meeting the defense organizations created in their name. Returning to Spain, they continued their tour through Andalusia in 1909.[5]
In July, Barcelona erupted in civil disorder known as Tragic Week,[5] and a court charged him with orchestrating it. Villafranca and her family testified at his trial, which resulted in him being sentenced to death. The Maura administration exiled Villafranca to Aragon, first in Alcañiz, then to Teruel. She continued to push for Ferrer's release, including protests and a request for a royal pardon.[6] After Ferrer's execution, she worked to keep his tradition alive.[2]
She was linked in the 1912 assassination of Prime Minister José Canalejas through its perpetrator, Manuel Pardiñas, an associate of Villafranca. She was accused of inciting the assassination without evidence, marred from her history of prior suspicions.[6]
Villafranca withdrew from activism after marrying in 1914. Her husband, Carlos Woessner, was a charcoal businessman from Germany who had considerable prestige in Barcelona.[6] Villafranca moved to Cologne during the Spanish Civil War and returned to Barcelona in 1939 after the war ended. She died there in 1948[2] or 1949.[6]

Francis has exhibited internationally[1] both individually and in group exhibitions. Indeed, his ""practice over the past thirty years has focused on making paintings with singular optical intensity — powerful, apparently abstract combinations of concentrated patterning and stark colour contrasts.""[2] As an emerging artist in 1995, Francis was involved in The Adventure of Painting[3] at Kunstverein Düsseldorf/Stuttgart, Germany and From Here at the Karsten Schubert/Waddington Galleries[4] in London. These shows were pivotal in questioning the role of contemporary painting both in Europe and the UK which consequently led Francis to show in prestigious exhibitions such as IMMA Glenn Dimplex Award exhibition Irish Museum of Modern Art (1996), Absolute Vision; New British Painting in the 1990s Museum of Modern Art Oxford (1996)[5]   and the infamous Sensation Young British Artists from the Saatchi Collection exhibition (1997). By the year 2000, Francis was invited to exhibit an early career overview Elements at Milton Keynes Gallery.[6]

The brow horns of Nasutoceratops are strongly curved; their bases are pointed forward and outwards, then curve inwards, and ultimately twist their points upwards. The horns are very elongated and span approximately 40% of total skull length, almost reaching the level of the snout tip. This horn configuration has been described as superficially similar to that of a Texas Longhorn bull. With a bone core length of up to  457 mm (18.0 in) in the holotype, the brow horns of Nasutoceratops are the longest known of any centrosaurine, both in absolute and relative terms. The majority of other centrosaurines had relatively short brow horns, with elongated horns only being present in basal forms like Diabloceratops, Avaceratops, and Albertaceratops. The brow horns of Nasutoceratops also differ from those of other ceratopsids by mainly pointing up and away from the eyes, without torsion.[4][5]

Producer Jack L. Warner was not impressed by Coppola's shaggy-haired, bearded, ""hippie"" appearance and generally left him to his own devices. Coppola took the cast to the  Napa Valley for much of the outdoor shooting, but those scenes were in sharp contrast to those filmed on a Hollywood soundstage, resulting in a disjointed look. None the less,  Finian's Rainbow (1968) was a critical and commercial success. Clark received a  Golden Globe Best Actress nomination. The film introduced Coppola to George Lucas, who became a lifelong friend and a production assistant on his next film.

The weave in 2D textiles is perpendicular. The yarn is fed along two axis: length (x-axis) and width (y-axis), while 3D textiles also have a perpendicular weave, but they have an extra yarn with an angular feeding (z-axis) which creates thickness.[1][clarification needed] 3D weaves are orthogonal weave structures, multilayer structures, and angle interlocks. 3D textiles have more manufacturing opportunities, various properties, and a broader scope of applications. These textiles have a wide range of applications, but they are most commonly used where performance is the primary criterion, such as technical textiles. Composite materials, manufacturing is one of the significant areas of using 3D textiles.[2][3][4][5][6]
