Subsequently, the squadron flew to join HMS Ark Royal near Malta in November. By the time of the Kuwait crisis in June 1961, the squadron was aboard the lead ship of her class, HMS Centaur, and it later operated in both the Far East and the Mediterranean regions before transferring to HMS Victorious in August 1963. This vessel then embarked on an extended deployment to the Far East, which included stops in Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines, and Australia.

In 1968, he would move up to compete in the 250cc Grand Prix world championship. Although the single cylinder Ossa had 20 horsepower (15 kW) less than the powerful V4 Yamahas of Phil Read and Bill Ivy, the Ossa was 45 pounds (20 kg) lighter and its monocoque frame was much stiffer, giving it superior agility.[2][3][5] Herrero was able to take advantage of the Ossa's light weight and superior handling characteristics to remain competitive, especially on tighter race tracks.[3][5][6] The Yamahas swept the championship, but Herrero's results left no doubt that the little Ossa was quick and dependable. He finished seventh in the championship and claimed a third place in the final race of the season at Monza.[1] He would once again take the 250cc Spanish National Championship.[4]",Herrero (62) competing in the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix.,"A black and white photograph of a motorcycle racer leaning into a turn on a racetrack.
