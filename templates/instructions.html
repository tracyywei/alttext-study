            <h1>⚠️ Instructions</h1>
      <p>In this task, you will be shown images taken from Wikipedia articles, along with the article name and some additional context. Your job is to select the best alt-text description for each image based on the following criteria. You will be given four similar alt-text options, and your goal is to choose the one that best fits the guidelines below.</p>

      <h2>How to Complete the Task:</h2>
      <ol>
          <li><strong>Review the Image:</strong> Take a moment to carefully examine the image presented to you.</li>
          <li><strong>Read the Article Context (Optional):</strong> You may read the article name and context provided below the image. This text can help you understand the surrounding information about the image. <strong><i>**However, you should use it only if additional context is necessary for understanding the image.**</i></strong></li>
          <li><strong>Review the Alt-Text Options:</strong> You will be presented with four alt-text descriptions. These are similar, but one will be the most accurate and concise based on the image and the criteria listed below.</li>
          <li><strong>Select the Best Alt-Text Option:</strong> Choose the alt-text that best fits the alt-text criteria.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Alt-Text Criteria:</h2>
      <ol>
          <li><strong>Keep it short and clear:</strong> 1-2 lines of plain text with no acronyms, abbreviations, or jargon.</li>
          <li><strong>Describe what can be seen:</strong> Focus only on what is visible in the image, without adding any personal interpretation, point of view, or research.</li>
          <li><strong>Focus on relevance to the article:</strong> Consider the text around it as context but don’t repeat the text.</li>
          <li><strong>Transcribe words and graphics:</strong> Write out any words in the image, in quotation marks, and summarize the main idea of maps, diagrams, and charts.</li>
          <li><strong>Type of image:</strong> Do not begin with "This is an image of...". If applicable, describe the medium or style of the image.</li>
          <li><strong>Take care with people:</strong> Identify public figures and make sure any description is relevant, apparent, and verifiable.</li>
          <li><strong>Follow standard alt-text conventions:</strong> The alt-text should not start with the phrase “Alt text:”. Simply describe the image itself.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Once you have reviewed the options, select the one that best follows these rules. Thank you for your participation!</p>
